&#x20;       I will never forget something that happened between my classmates and me when I was 10 years old. I still have a vivid memory of that humble moment. Then, our school held a small contest about English dramas, and the team which won the contest would get the chance to perform an English drama outside the school. Not all classes prepared for the competition, and neither did my class. For the sake of my enthusiasm for performing dramas, I made a resolution to team up with another team founded by many many students from different classes.

&#x20;       In the beginning, we didn't do well, but soon we got along with one another. Not only did we become friends, but we also helped one another when facing some issues such as no practice places for us or someone being upset because others laughed at us. Overcoming all the obstacles along the road to success, we finally finished an amazing drama that was surely better than all the other teams'. On the performing stage, we acted well, and there was nothing wrong until the final part.

&#x20;       After acting for more than ten minutes, all the actors and actresses were exhausted and started to make small mistakes. The first one was mine, soon another mistake occurred, and so on. The audience started to mock at us for our failure, we being increasingly nervous. Suddenly, a big voice woke us up. "Under the stage are those who don't have the courage to perform anything on stage! Do you know how brave we are, how cowardly they are, and how amazing our drama is?" We were shocked. Finally, we finished our performance with the 3rd place. Overwhelmed by depression, I felt ashamed during the whole day. "I should have paid more attention then!" I apologized to all my teammates sincerely, and one of them told me a thing that I would never forget: "How brave we are to perform on stage?"

&#x20;       I have kept the motto in mind for about four years long from then on. After that embarrassing performance, whenever I performed on stage, I would keep my chin up even though my performance was awful because I have convinced myself that no matter how bad I was, I was the bravest at all! With this belief, I will never surrender to embarrassment and I will keep walking forward to the final success in my life.

### After

&#x20;       Never will I forget the embarrassing moment happened between my classmates and me when I was 10 years old. It remains a vivid and unforgettable memory in my mind. At that time, my school held a small contest about English dramas, and the team winning the contest would be entitled to perform an English drama outside the school. My school didn't ask all classes to attend the event, though, and hence only some classes prepared for it. My class, neither. To feed my desire for performing dramas, I resolved to team up with some "homeless" students who came from different classes that didn't prepare for the drama, either.

&#x20;       Unfamiliar as we were, we soon got along and even carried one another through difficulties we encountered such as no practice places for us. We discussed the issue for a couple of minutes and finally reached a consensus that we would practice the drama together in the English classroom after school. Practice makes perfect. We eventually created a wonderful drama that no other team could beat. On the performing stage, we acted very well at first, leaving the audience stunned in awe of our performing skills, and our confidence grew bigger and bigger with the applause between every act.

&#x20;       We were all exhausted after performing for more than 10 minutes. Despite our best efforts, we started to forget the lines. The first mistake was made by me, and it surely ruined the whole performance. Soon, another mistake occurred, and I could see the audience wrinkling and feeling confused, some of which even started to mock at us for our failure. We felt depressed and became increasingly nervous. Suddenly, a voice woke us up, rescuing all the sinking teammates from the failure marsh. "Under the stage are those who dare not perform on stage! We are much braver than them! Do you remember that our drama is the best of all the teams'?" We were shocked and stopped performing for 5 seconds, during which silence swallowed the whole room. Then, we restarted the drama, completed it successfully, and got deafening applause at last!

&#x20;       We were the 3rd place since the last act of our drama was messed up. I was overwhelmed by depression, for I was the one who destroyed the whole performance. "I should have paid more attention at that time!" I apologized to all my teammates sincerely. Surprisingly, they didn't feel angry, and one of them even told me a thing that I would never forget: "Don't feel ashamed! We are the best, so we can perform on stage!"

&#x20;       I have kept the motto in my mind for 4 years long from then on. With that impressive experience, whenever I stood on stage to give a speech to my classmates, I would always keep my chin up even though my performance was awful because I had convinced myself that however bad I was, I was the best at all! With the inspiring belief, I will never surrender to any embarrassment. Instead, I will keep walking forward the royal road to the final success in my life.

## 作文二：A Dear John Letter

Dear John,

&#x20;       I feel very hesitant when I am writing this letter, but on seeing my test paper, I eventually made up my mind and made the resolution to break up with you. Satisfying and amazing though our relationships have been during our junior high school lives, I notice that my relationships with my friends and family have been getting worse since last year, the year we truly fell in love with each other. I can recall all the memories between you and me, but now, unfortunately, I must stop the romantic relationship with you from now on.

&#x20;       Remember last time we hung out with each other? I couldn't help laughing at the top of my lungs throughout the whole trip because of the funny shirt you wore. We watched movies, ate local cuisines, and confided in each other at that time. All this seemed to be wonderful, but after the trip I found that I could hardly concentrate in class, for I kept thinking about you during the class.

&#x20;       What's more, my family kept complaining that I always sticked to the phone screen until it was too late. Overcome by fatigue, I even began to take a nap during class. My homeroom teacher usually lost his temper, hit the table, and scolded me right away. Soon I realized that all I had to do was focus on studies, so I couldn't spend as much time as I used to do on you anymore.

&#x20;       We can still maintain our relationships, but we shouldn't be on intimate terms. There's no denying that leaving you makes me sad; however, we have to face the reality instead of indulging ourselves in the romantic life we have shared with each other. Tearfully ending the letter, I would like to thank you and give you my best wishes.

Love,\
Sally.

Dear John,

&#x20;       I felt very hesitant when I was writing this letter, but on seeing my transcript, I eventually made up my mind and resolved to break up with you. Satisfying and amazing though the life you have brought for me since I was a junior school student, I notice that I'm being farther and farther from my friends, and my family has scolded me for my awful academic performance for a long time. I can recall all the memories between you and me, but now, unfortunately, I must stop the romantic relationship with you and go back down to earth.

&#x20;       Do you remember our first date? I couldn't help laughing at the top of my lungs throughout the whole trip because of the funny shirt you wore. We watched movies and tasted many delectable cuisines together. Then, we walked along the riverside, enjoyed the beautiful fireworks, and confided in each other. It's was at that time that I found we were head over heels in love. Since the trip, we became way closer than before. Every day when I woke up, I couldn't wait to read your messages; whenever I suffered from depression, you would always be my shelter, say funny things to comfort me, and be by my side throughout the day; at home, we talked hours and hours about the sweet and the sour on phone, indulging ourselves in the romantic world we created. These seem to be wonderful, but recently I have found that I cannot even concentrate in class, for I keep thinking about you during the class. Thus, my grade is just like a waterfall, dropping drastically.

&#x20;       What's more, my parents refused to give their consent to our relationship because they thought that I was still too young to have a boyfriend, and it was absolutely not worthwhile to glue my eyes to the phone screen until late at night just in case I missed any update you made. Sometimes I would even stay up the whole night and hence take a nap during class. My homeroom teacher usually lost his temper, hit the table, and gave me a stern talking-to about my grave mistake right away. Soon I realized that all I had to do was focus on studies, so I should not spend as much time as I used to do on you anymore.

&#x20;       We can still maintain a normal relationship, but we shouldn't be on intimate terms. There's no denying that leaving you makes me sad; however, this is how cruel the reality is. Were you me, you would make the same determination, wouldn't you? Tearfully ending the letter, I would like to thank you and give you my best wishes.

Love,\
Sally.

## 作文三：What I Am Concerned About

### Before

<div align="left"><figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt="" width="528"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>

&#x20;       Speaking of the environmental issues that we are being confronted with nowadays, I will choose the exhaust discharged by vehicles because I hate to breathe it in when I am waiting for a traffic light to turn to green. Why not turn off the power while waiting for it especially when it takes a long time? Recently, I have introduced the notion of turning off the power to my brother and some of his friends.

&#x20;       Many people will feel very hot and uncomfortable when they are stuck in the traffic, and that is because of the exhaust that their cars or vehicles discharge. Hence, turning off the power can decrease the exhaust, and it has been proved by my father. Last time, we turned off the power when waiting for the traffic light, and we felt that the air suddenly got so fresh as if it has been in autumn already, but it was summer in fact!

&#x20;       Overall, it is time that we helped save the earth instead of being indifferent to it. Also, it was my father that introduced the notion of turning off the power to me, so we should promote this idea and give it to our next generation. Let's turn off the power of the vehicles, and also the one of the earth to lower the temperature from now on!

### After

&#x20;       Speaking of the environmental issues that we are being confronted with nowadays, I will choose the exhaust discharged by vehicles. For one thing, it will heat up everything around it, making people uncomfortable and even faint. For another, the exhaust contains many poisonous substances that may cause cancers.

&#x20;       The first problem can be easily solved by turning off vehicles' power. It requires a little time to turn on the power again, so this method can only be applied when you are waiting for the traffic light, especially when it takes quite a lot of time to turn green. Otherwise, you are likely to receive an annoying response from other riders, which may account for a small quarrel. In fact, it was my father that introduced this concept to me, and I have also promoted this way to my brother and his friends as well. It was quite hot last summer, and when my father took me out for a ride, I felt very uncomfortable while we were waiting for the traffic light beside many vehicles, but when we rode forward a little and turn off the power, I felt totally different: the air was so cool and fresh as if it had been autumn already! My father claimed that it was because of the exhaust the vehicles discharged that caused the environment to become increasingly hotter, and this notion had been proved by my previous experience with him.

&#x20;       The other problem can be settled by doing a regular check of your vehicle. Although the government has urged people to have their vehicles checked every year, many people are still reluctant to do it. Accordingly, the government should encourage them by rewarding them with bonus money if they adhere to the regulations. Moreover, the government should impose stricter punishments such as doubled fines on them or even suspending their driving licenses.

&#x20;       Overall, it is high time that we helped save the earth instead of being indifferent to it, and we should promote the ideas mentioned-above to others and give them to our next generation. Turn off your vehicle's power and have your vehicle checked regularly, and let's heal our vulnerable earth from now on. Remember, a small everyday effort can mean a lot to the whole world!
