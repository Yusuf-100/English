#### 111年

* Featuring slides for kids to have thrilling rides on, the place is synonymous with "the heaven of happiness for pre-school kids."
* My ideal park would be both eco-friendly and user-friendly, especially for the elderly, since aging has been an imminent problem in Taiwan. As the senior citizens have contributed their prime years to our society, it is high time we hold them in high esteem.
* A walk in the park would restore one's once impaired relationship with nature.
* Trees and bushes, grassy fields as far as the eye could see, and the chirping of birds along with azure sky and sun-kissed ambiance, are all interwoven into a glamorous, picturesque view.
* Furthermore, there should be a multitude of facilities and services that cater to the need of both ordinary park goers and physically challenged people alike.

* Tourists joyfully stroll around in the field, taking pictures and having a good time, while the poor flowers are mercilessly trampled all over under their shoes.
* Yet, instead of an unharmed flower bed splendid as always, I get a messy and chaotic garden left behind by tourists.
* Without a doubt, I totally agree that we should all have some sense of morality imprinted in our minds.
* As the proud owner of this vast field of flowers, I am not only furious, but also devastated to see this painful sight.
* Moreover, I have grown a deep affection for these flowers, as I have spent countless hours taking care of them, from watering them with care to fertilizing them with love, and to see the people trample over them makes me feel disgusted by their outrageous behavior.
* It was refreshing morning with <mark style="color:blue;">**myriads of**</mark> blooms generously showing their captivating fragrance and <mark style="color:blue;">**bold, bright vibrant colors**</mark>.
* Some beautiful ladies in rosy outfits <mark style="color:blue;">**trampled on**</mark> my previous roses while teenagers broke the branches, <mark style="color:blue;">**picking my adorable tulips away**</mark>.
* Once these <mark style="color:blue;">**vulnerable**</mark> blossoms are sabotaged, other visitors will lose the chance to appreciate <mark style="color:blue;">**the splendid view**</mark>.
* Spring is the season of flowers and butterflies. Crowds of tourists were <mark style="color:blue;">**flocking into**</mark> the fabulous garden to <mark style="color:blue;">**catch a glimpse of**</mark> its beauty. Upon arriving the tourist attraction, <mark style="color:blue;">**one was greeted by**</mark> different types of flowers. There were cherry blossoms in full bloom, sun flowers beckoning to people enthusiastically, and colorful butterflies dancing gracefully.
* Therefore, I can <mark style="color:blue;">**file lawsuits against them for trespassing and property damage**</mark>. Second, I had already <mark style="color:blue;">**put up a sign**</mark> asking them to <mark style="color:blue;">**refrain from**</mark> entering and stepping on the plants.

* The moment the doors opened, people poured into the store and rushed to get the goods at a discounted price. Clerks were busy promoting their products while customers listened with keen interest.
* Mr. Lin put his hands into his pocket, groping for his wallet. He gasped in shock.
* Mr. Lin sighed in relief.
* When the glass door finally opened, all of them rushed into the mall as if they were ambitious horses plunging headlong to the battlefield ready for a good fight.
* They made up their mind that they would not go shopping in the mall during the anniversary sale anymore because being packed like sardines was the last thing they wanted to do.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**With my heart beating rapidly in excitement**</mark>, I tried to look past the sea of people and see through the large glass windows of the department store.
* Suddenly, <mark style="color:blue;">**the glass doors burst open**</mark>. I watched as men and women in front of me <mark style="color:blue;">**flooded into**</mark> the store. <mark style="color:blue;">**All around me were people crammed like sardines in a tin, pushing each other, eager to get in**</mark>.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**With a swipe of the credit card**</mark>, tens of thousands of dollars are gone <mark style="color:blue;">**in exchange for**</mark> a single bottle of facial cream and foundation, which is worth nearly my monthly salary.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Within the blink of an eye**</mark>, the entire mall was filled with <mark style="color:blue;">**people from all walks of life, all of whom shared the same goal**</mark>, shopping.
* The truth was, although there had been <mark style="color:blue;">**a staggering amount**</mark> of goods sold <mark style="color:blue;">**at tempting prices**</mark>, nothing had caught her eye in particular. In the end, all she'd gotten in exchange for the trouble was a stolen phone and <mark style="color:blue;">**sore, aching feet**</mark> after standing so long.

* Tiny as the island may be, it boasts its mountains up to the altitude of 3,000 meters, emerald plains stretched on the west coast, and glittering oceans surrounding the island.
* In addition, the aboriginal culture, Chinese culture and Japanese culture make Taiwan a fertile land to cultivate all kinds of ethnic groups, enabling it to stand out from all the other countries around the globe.
* Spending a whole afternoon in Taiwan, people can regain the warmth and pleasure of historical wisdom by visiting several old castles, majestic temples, and time honored ruins.
* Taiwan, my dear hometown, is an island of awe-inspiring natural beauty and thought-provoking cultural treasure.
* The National Healthcare Insurance, which was launched in 1995, provides high-quality medical assistance to nearly all of its citizens. The insurance is mandatory and runs on a sliding scale, meaning that the amount you pay is based on how much you earn. This makes it much more affordable to the public.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Reconciling economic development with environmental and historic preservation**</mark>, Taiwanese have protected these beautiful treasures from being destroyed.
* Besides <mark style="color:blue;">**the lively atmosphere**</mark>, the tradition associated with and the efforts given to those foods are what I take pride in most. Many of the food in Taiwan indeed have their origins traced back to hundreds of years ago before they were brought by our ancestors. It is our forefathers who came settling here that made some changes to the food they were familiar with to adapt to the lifestyles here. The culture and the devotion behind these Taiwanese snacks are thus more <mark style="color:blue;">**of significance**</mark>.
* In my opinion, we can utilize the Internet and <mark style="color:blue;">**take advantage of its accessibility**</mark>. For instance, the government can turn to some bloggers and Youtubers for help. In their blogs or channels, they can introduce some of Taiwan's tourist attractions to their audience. Once interested in Taiwan, the viewers will subscribe to the videos, and keep tabs on them, longing for further information.
* Or we can hold more international events or competitions, such as the Taroko Valley Biking Race, which can appeal to bikes around the globe and present <mark style="color:blue;">**the natural splendor**</mark> along the route to the world at the same time.
* Taking part in global activities, such as sports events and exhibitions, will also be <mark style="color:blue;">**of great help**</mark>. Take the 2017 Summer Universiade in Taipei for example. The theme song was performed in an aboriginal language, widely praised by thousands of people. <mark style="color:blue;">**So popular the event was that it led to a spike in tourism, with many opting to**</mark> have a look around after attending the sports games.

* We tried to lift our spirits by imagining the richness of the donuts' chocolate coating, the crispy texture of the well-baked bread, as well as the savory sweetness that would linger on our taste buds for weeks. However, hours of waiting eventually dampened our enthusiasm.
* In my opinion, there's no denying that curiosity can be a strong incentive to stand in a long line for a new item that's raging like a storm.
* The time dragged and my mother became restless.
* After waiting for two solid hours, it was finally our turn. We walked in the restaurant in a jubilant mood and relished the laid-back atmosphere in the restaurant.
* Since we are exposed to a colossal amount of knowledge, the ability to think independently becomes particularly important.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Much to my disappointment**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**after another one hour**</mark>, I walked out of the restaurant <mark style="color:blue;">**in a gloomy mood**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**It turned out**</mark> that this lunch became one of the most horrible experiences of mine.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**It was an hour of squirming, fanning ourselves and straining our necks to peek over heads before we saw the puffs of steam rising into the sky of the sweltering summer night. It was another thirty minutes before we made it through the crows of heads over which it was seen.**</mark>
* With the image of a creamy treat forming in my mind, I could feel the silky texture of sweetness in my mouth. That's when I <mark style="color:blue;">**had the urge to**</mark> try out the well-praised ice-cream shop. <mark style="color:blue;">**Overwhelmed with**</mark> excitement and joy, I headed for the shop.
* As far as I'm concerned, such phenomenon is not very <mark style="color:blue;">**desirable**</mark>. After all, those people forming lines are just motivated by a fad that will <mark style="color:blue;">**subside in no time**</mark>.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Had it not been for**</mark> queuing up, people could have had an opportunity to complete something of more significance. <mark style="color:blue;">**Indulging themselves in the awe-inspiring natural splendor**</mark> is, for example, far more fabulous a thing to do.

* With immense zeal and a sense of elation filling my heart, I jumped off the stairs at the front door of my house, radiated a splendid smile on my face and walked up to help Mom and Dad pack our stuff for the family trip I had been looking forward to for so long.

* When all the other cars were dozing off in the blazing summer heat, Arnold stayed awake and alert. He was waiting for the Lins to come back. He did not complain.
* It almost took us an hour to buy the ticket as well as set foot on the <mark style="color:blue;">**sought-after**</mark> amusement park. <mark style="color:blue;">**Much to my astonishment**</mark>, when I walked through the entrance, all of the staff clapped their hands and cheered. <mark style="color:blue;">**Unable to realize what had happened, I was given a beautifully-wrapped gift**</mark>. "Congratulations!" <mark style="color:blue;">**exclaimed**</mark> the staff. We were later <mark style="color:blue;">**informed**</mark> that we were the 2000th guest on that day.
* At first, I only <mark style="color:blue;">**gave little credence to**</mark> what she had said. Then I turned on the TV and found that it was true that the malfunction of the roller coaster had <mark style="color:blue;">**claimed lots of lives**</mark> in Adventureland. <mark style="color:blue;">**Stunned and startled**</mark>, we couldn't utter a word as <mark style="color:blue;">**our minds went blank**</mark>.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Neither did he expect the parking lot**</mark>. When the Lins got out of his doors and ran off  to the water park without him, Arnold almost yelled "Hey, I", but then he remember he was a good car, and he stayed where he was while the ground cooked his tires, and <mark style="color:blue;">**the sun grilled his hood**</mark>. When all the other cars were dozing off in <mark style="color:blue;">**the blazing summer heat**</mark>, Arnold <mark style="color:blue;">**stayed awake and alert**</mark>. He was waiting for the Lins to come back. He did not complain. He was a good car.

* I still remember the first time I did the dishes. It was in the winter, and everything I touched, except for the grease, was cold, the freezing water in particular.

## 英文看圖作文注意事項

* 花時間看清圖片不要離題/ 觀察人物與背景/ 記住文章要寫出「人事時地物」\
  主角是誰?出現在什麼樣的時空背景?接著看看人物的表情及動作，試著將人物與背景的關係建立起來。
* 盡可能敘述完整圖片裡的情節\
  圖片所給的東西盡可能地把它敘述完整，但這不代表圖上沒有的東西我們不可以把它寫入文章裡。只要是合理且有助於故事發展的內容，都可以盡情發揮。但是也要避免提及無關緊要的細節。例如，明明是要講喝酒，卻一直提到宴會的食物很好吃，見到朋友很開心...，這樣當然就會模糊焦點。同樣的，要「深入的細節」，而非「廣雜的細節」：例如當你要敘述一個戀人在公園裡等待對方到來的情境，很多同學描寫過多公園的景色，模糊了重點。要寫的細節應該是要對戀人培養情緒有用的背景，例如戀人不斷看到有好多情侶檔手牽手，或是可以寫戀人是如何期待這次的約會，買了最好看的洋裝、項鍊，或是寫她在公園引頸期盼的表情、動作，這些才是「深入的細節」。
* 用字\
  記敘文要用確切的單字，不宜用太艱深的單字。善用片語、轉折語，句型可以有變化，但不宜太花俏。\
  a. 增加動作動詞的詞彙量以精確描寫圖中人物的動作。\
  give it a light press/ draw his sword/ pin a red flower on his breast/ insert a key in a hole/ bang the box down on the counter/ scrape the rust off the machine/ wave goodbye to sb/ squeeze the juice out of an orange/ walk arm-in-arm/ tiptoe to the bedside/ stamp one's foot/ lean against sth/ race home/ spring out of bed/ whisper/ mutter/ beg/ exclaim/ groan\
  b. 形容詞和副詞可以幫助描寫圖中人物的內心狀態或圖中的景色以增加文章的豐富度，可以使用的句型為make/ keep/ leave sb O.C.、with + O + O.C.、分詞構句等。\
  walk at a quick pace/ walk with a slouch/ jump about in excitement/ He stands there rooted to the spot, stunned and speechless./ He stands there with his hands on his hips./ Tired from his walk, he plumps into a chair.\
  c. 從單字本找出適合自己使用的英文單字。
* 可以發揮創意想像力但劇情過程必須合理化\
  圖片與圖片之間都有一個過程，一定要清楚交代每兩張圖片之間所發生的事。這些都是你一開始設定故事大綱時就要底定的，最好不要邊寫邊想。
* 平均分配每張圖和圖與圖之間的字數\
  當然通常中間的圖片會是故事的重心所在，結尾的圖片可能會是故事的高潮點，此時字數可以多一些，但比例仍不能過於失衡。
* Point of view/ 取名\
  可以試著由不同的角度去寫看圖作文，但所使用的人或動物必須在三張圖片中皆有出現，故事主角一定有名字，比較好稱呼。
* 時態\
  a. 看圖作文多是記敘文，因此時態以過去式為主。但若是對話中的文字，則應以當時所欲表達的時態為主來表示。\
  next day -> the next day/ yesterday -> the previous day/ after three weeks -> three weeks later/ today morning -> this morning\
  b. 注意不規則動詞的過去式。
* 有創意但不失合理化的結尾\
  因為看圖作文結尾往往是劇情高潮，所以最好能夠寫很有創意的情節。\
  Tim woke up in a tidy office, not knowing when it was and where he was. Then, a policeman walked toward him angrily. Yawning loudly, he took a closer look. To his astonishment, it was his father. His father told him what had happened. While his father was patrolling the streets and found him drunk, he dropped and took him to the police station. His father admonished him not to make the same mistake again. Tim felt embarrassed and promise not to drink so much next time.
* 一定要留幾分鐘(例如5分鐘)檢查作文的拼字、文法及內容是否有誤
* 易犯的錯誤\
  a. 「」-> " "\
  b. 標點符號不能出現在句首。\
  c. because, even if, although, when, while 等所帶出的為附屬子句，不是一完整句不可以句點結尾。\
  d. so, and, because, but 通常不放在句首。\
  e. 第三人稱單數動詞要加s或es\
  f. 可數名詞要標明單複數。\
  g. 不規則動詞的過去式要注意(teach -> taught)\
  h. 主詞和代名詞要一致(people -> they)\
  i. 若使用泛主詞，全文的用法要一致。\
  j. 雖為看圖作文，但文章中的直接對話不宜太多，以免淪為劇本的形式而非作文。

* Much to my surprise, no sooner had I voiced my opinion than Jeff glared at me. He thought it was no big deal, and I was just kicking up a fuss.

Ever since then, I remind myself not to brush aside little things as unimportant and make sure to do full research before indulging myself in an activity. After all, one can never be too careful.
