1. Have you ever given a special present to somebody? I have. Although it was not an expensive gift, it <mark style="color:blue;">**turned out**</mark> to be a very useful one. My grandfather, a <mark style="color:blue;">**serious**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**stubborn**</mark>, and <mark style="color:blue;">**frugal**</mark> person, had smoked for almost thirty years. Last year, I spent a lot of time <mark style="color:blue;">**choosing**</mark> a birthday gift for him.
2. It was an <mark style="color:blue;">**ashtray**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**with**</mark> a black <mark style="color:blue;">**skull**</mark> on it. When he opened the gift, I saw a strange smile on his face. After a <mark style="color:blue;">**while**</mark>, he started <mark style="color:blue;">**admonishing**</mark> me that I should not spend so much money <mark style="color:blue;">**buying**</mark> a gift for him.
3. Two days <mark style="color:blue;">**later**</mark>, I found that he used <mark style="color:blue;">**neither**</mark> the new <mark style="color:blue;">**ashtray**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**nor**</mark> the old one. <mark style="color:blue;">**From then on**</mark>, I <mark style="color:blue;">**was**</mark> not <mark style="color:blue;">**exposed to**</mark> heavy smoke anymore. I was so happy that I had <mark style="color:blue;">**achieved**</mark> my original <mark style="color:blue;">**purpose**</mark> selecting this gift.
4. My grandfather <mark style="color:blue;">**quit smoking**</mark> because of the <mark style="color:blue;">**ashtray**</mark> I had given to him. <mark style="color:blue;">**What a miracle**</mark> it was! Now, my grandfather has <mark style="color:blue;">**quit smoking**</mark> for more than one year.
5. <mark style="color:blue;">**On**</mark> last Father's Day, I gave him a present, which <mark style="color:blue;">**had nothing to do with**</mark> smoking. I bought him a shirt and a card to show my <mark style="color:blue;">**respect**</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">**concern**</mark> for him. On the card I write, "<mark style="color:blue;">**In exchange for**</mark> the <mark style="color:blue;">**ashtray**</mark> that you have never used and will never use."

1. Do you know that each year around 5% of all high school <mark style="color:blue;">**graduates**</mark> choose to study <mark style="color:blue;">**abroad**</mark>? <mark style="color:blue;">**Nowadays**</mark>, college students study <mark style="color:blue;">**abroad for**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**various**</mark> reasons. <mark style="color:blue;">**In my opinion**</mark>, two major <mark style="color:blue;">**factors**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**are responsible for**</mark> this <mark style="color:blue;">**trend**</mark>.
2. <mark style="color:blue;">**For one thing**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**pursuing**</mark> studies in a foreign culture helps <mark style="color:blue;">**expand one's horizons**</mark>. In a foreign country, students need to <mark style="color:blue;">**interact with**</mark> people who <mark style="color:blue;">**lead**</mark> a different life, speak a new language, and <mark style="color:blue;">**embrace**</mark> novel ideas.
3. In the <mark style="color:blue;">**process**</mark>, they learn to see things from different <mark style="color:blue;">**angles**</mark>. Also, students believe having a foreign <mark style="color:blue;">**diploma**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**enhances**</mark> their <mark style="color:blue;">**competitiveness**</mark> in the job market. Many companies or <mark style="color:blue;">**enterprises**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**favor**</mark> those who <mark style="color:blue;">**attended**</mark> an overseas university. Therefore, <mark style="color:blue;">**graduates**</mark> from <mark style="color:blue;">**prestigious**</mark> universities abroad may <mark style="color:blue;">**stand out**</mark> from other <mark style="color:blue;">**candidates**</mark>.
4. If the <mark style="color:blue;">**option**</mark> to study overseas presents itself, I will <mark style="color:blue;">**definitely**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**take on the challenge**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**I have been dreaming of studying abroad for years**</mark>. By <mark style="color:blue;">**interacting with**</mark> those in a different <mark style="color:blue;">**social context**</mark>, I think I will learn to <mark style="color:blue;">**put things into perspective**</mark> and develop a <mark style="color:blue;">**global mindset**</mark>.
5. <mark style="color:blue;">**Besides**</mark>, studying abroad would <mark style="color:blue;">**provide**</mark> me <mark style="color:blue;">**with**</mark> an opportunity to make friends from different backgrounds. I think this would come naturally to me since I am an <mark style="color:blue;">**open-minded**</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">**outgoing**</mark> person. <mark style="color:blue;">**In conclusion**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**so long as**</mark> money isn't an <mark style="color:blue;">**issue**</mark>, I will surely choose to study overseas to challenge and push  myself to a higher level of <mark style="color:blue;">**excellence**</mark>.

1. Dear chil&#x64;**,** \
   When you read this, you'll be in high school. What an exciting time it <mark style="color:blue;">**must**</mark> be for you! At the time I am writing this, I am also a high schooler. I'm enjoying my life <mark style="color:blue;">**as**</mark> a teenager ─ I <mark style="color:blue;">**hang out**</mark> with my friends a lot, listen to great music, and <mark style="color:blue;">**play sports**</mark> on the weekends.
2. I won't say everything is <mark style="color:blue;">**rosy**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**though**</mark>. There are times I feel <mark style="color:blue;">**overwhelmed**</mark> by my studies and the growing <mark style="color:blue;">**pains**</mark> of <mark style="color:blue;">**being stuck**</mark> between childhood and <mark style="color:blue;">**adulthood**</mark>.
3. I'm not sure how the world will have changed <mark style="color:blue;">**by the time**</mark> you read this. However, I think every teenager shares the experience of trying to <mark style="color:blue;">**figure out**</mark> who they are and how they <mark style="color:blue;">**fit in**</mark>.
4. I want to tell you: don't worry too much about your <mark style="color:blue;">**current**</mark> problems. Some things may feel like the end of the world, but they will pass and you'll have better times <mark style="color:blue;">**ahead**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**Keep your chin up**</mark>! You come from a strong mother, so I know you're a strong child!\
   &#x20;                                                                                                                                           All my lov&#x65;**,**\
   &#x20;                                                                                                                                                      Mom

1. There are times in life when you get <mark style="color:blue;">**misunderstood**</mark>. I myself was <mark style="color:blue;">**seriously misunderstood**</mark> once. It happened in my second year in senior high school. My class was having the <mark style="color:blue;">**mid-term**</mark> on math.
2. I just finished all the test questions and began to <mark style="color:blue;">**stretch**</mark> myself and turn my neck to relax. The teacher <mark style="color:blue;">**monitoring**</mark> the exam saw me and thought I was trying to <mark style="color:blue;">**glance at**</mark> someone else's answers. He shouted, "Stop <mark style="color:blue;">**cheating**</mark>!"
3. I was so shocked that I didn't know <mark style="color:blue;">**what to do**</mark>. He asked me to <mark style="color:blue;">**hand in**</mark> my exam paper and took me to my <mark style="color:blue;">**homeroom teacher**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**telling**</mark> her that I was trying to cheat. I explained to my teacher what I was doing. Fortunately, she chose to believe me.
4. As I was walking out the door, my <mark style="color:blue;">**homeroom teacher**</mark> told me something that I would never forget, "Never do anything to <mark style="color:blue;">**arouse suspicion**</mark>." I have <mark style="color:blue;">**kept that in mind**</mark> ever since. Now, every time I <mark style="color:blue;">**take**</mark> an exam, I will be very careful <mark style="color:blue;">**so as not to**</mark> be misunderstood. That experience really <mark style="color:blue;">**taught me a lesson**</mark>.

1. Everyone is scared of something at some point in their lives. For me, that fear was public speaking. For years, the <mark style="color:blue;">**very**</mark> thought of speaking in front of crowds would <mark style="color:blue;">**send a chill down my spine**</mark>. Not only would the fear <mark style="color:blue;">**strike**</mark> me when I <mark style="color:blue;">**addressed**</mark> large crowds, but it also <mark style="color:blue;">**took hold of me**</mark> when I had to read aloud in class.
2. <mark style="color:blue;">**So scared was I**</mark> that I would freeze like a <mark style="color:blue;">**statue**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**stuttering**</mark> throughout the whole speech. This inability thus <mark style="color:blue;">**cost**</mark> me lots of opportunities to clearly express my ideas and <mark style="color:blue;">**demonstrate**</mark> my skills to others. At the heart of this problem was a lack of <mark style="color:blue;">**confidence**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**in**</mark> myself. I was afraid that others might consider my ideas <mark style="color:blue;">**mundane**</mark> or <mark style="color:blue;">**absurd**</mark> even though I had never been told so.
3. Therefore, one way to <mark style="color:blue;">**conquer**</mark> my fear was to <mark style="color:blue;">**silence**</mark> my negative <mark style="color:blue;">**inner voice**</mark> by reminding myself that I'd made full preparations and that I wasn't <mark style="color:blue;">**inferior to**</mark> others. Another way was to <mark style="color:blue;">**frequently**</mark> practice speaking skill. With the <mark style="color:blue;">**above-mentioned approaches**</mark>, I finally <mark style="color:blue;">**overcame**</mark> my fear, becoming a calmer, more <mark style="color:blue;">**confident**</mark> speaker on stage.

1. Having studied all day, Jack was <mark style="color:blue;">**exhausted**</mark> when he left the <mark style="color:blue;">**cram school**</mark> at ten o'clock. He <mark style="color:blue;">**dragged**</mark> his tired body along the street. Luckily, a bus <mark style="color:blue;">**pulled up**</mark> just as he reached the bus stop. <mark style="color:blue;">**Without hesitation**</mark>, he got on the bus and chose a seat next to a cute girl.
2. <mark style="color:blue;">**Overcome by fatigue**</mark>, Jack fell asleep and began to dream. In the dream, he was dating a beautiful girl and they were having a big meal. As me dreamed, he opened his mouth and began to <mark style="color:blue;">**drool**</mark>. What was more, he <mark style="color:blue;">**leaned**</mark> his head <mark style="color:blue;">**against**</mark> the shoulder of the girl next to him and <mark style="color:blue;">**snored**</mark> loudly. This really <mark style="color:blue;">**embarrassed**</mark> the girl.
3. <mark style="color:blue;">**Hard as she tried**</mark>, she couldn't wake Jack up. After a few minutes, she couldn't <mark style="color:blue;">**stand**</mark> it any more, so she <mark style="color:blue;">**rose**</mark> from seat and stood <mark style="color:blue;">**by**</mark> the door. Jack kept sleeping for quite a long while. Finally, he woke up and found that he was at the bus <mark style="color:blue;">**terminal**</mark>, which was far from his home.
4. He looked at his watch and found it was almost eleven o'clock. It was impossible for him to take another bus home. Feeling cold and hungry, he <mark style="color:blue;">**had no choice but to**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**hail a taxi**</mark>, which cost him almost five hundred dollars. After that, he <mark style="color:blue;">**vowed**</mark> that he would never sleep on the bus again.

1. Dear Teacher,\
   I need to discuss with you some <mark style="color:blue;">**bullying**</mark> that has been <mark style="color:blue;">**taking place**</mark> in our class. One boy in our class, Mark, is not as <mark style="color:blue;">**masculine**</mark> as some of the other boys in the class. For this reason, many of the boys <mark style="color:blue;">**look down on**</mark> him, especially the more popular classmates. Mark <mark style="color:blue;">**barely**</mark> has any friends in class. What's more, the <mark style="color:blue;">**remaining**</mark> few who stand by him are <mark style="color:blue;">**threatened**</mark> by the <mark style="color:blue;">**bullies**</mark>. If they dare to <mark style="color:blue;">**lend**</mark> Mark <mark style="color:blue;">**a hand**</mark>, they will <mark style="color:blue;">**suffer from**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**isolation**</mark> in consequence.
2. I know how troublesome it is to deal with something like this, but it's still necessary to do so. <mark style="color:blue;">**Isolation**</mark> has a disastrous <mark style="color:blue;">**impact**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**on**</mark> one's mental development. Should the <mark style="color:blue;">**current**</mark> situation continue, Mark may have difficulty <mark style="color:blue;">**interacting**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**with**</mark> people in years to come. Besides, it's <mark style="color:blue;">**critical**</mark> to teach students to respect those who are different from them. If you are able to help, I'm sure Mark would be <mark style="color:blue;">**eternally**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**grateful to**</mark> you.

1. Last Friday my classmates and I went on a <mark style="color:blue;">**field trip**</mark> to the zoo with our teacher. Before we entered the zoo, the teacher gave each of us a <mark style="color:blue;">**worksheet**</mark>. He asked us to <mark style="color:blue;">**observe**</mark> the animals' living and health conditions and <mark style="color:blue;">**take notes**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**To be honest**</mark>, in the beginning we just took the trip as an <mark style="color:blue;">**outing**</mark> in which we would be able to take tons of <mark style="color:blue;">**selfies**</mark> with lovely animals.
2. However, our <mark style="color:blue;">**cheerful mood**</mark> changed when we saw the animals in the cages: some <mark style="color:blue;">**lay**</mark> quite <mark style="color:blue;">**lifeless**</mark> on the ground, <mark style="color:blue;">**others**</mark> looked frightened by the huge numbers of visitors and <mark style="color:blue;">**still**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**others**</mark> seemed lonely. Gazing at these <mark style="color:blue;">**imprisoned**</mark> unhappy <mark style="color:blue;">**creatures**</mark>, I <mark style="color:blue;">**couldn't help but**</mark> imagine how I would feel if I lived <mark style="color:blue;">**in captivity**</mark> like this.
3. I would not need to worry about lacking food to eat, but I would not be able to run <mark style="color:blue;">**free**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**in the wild**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**Instead of**</mark> living with my family and friends, I would be surrounded and watched by strangers every day. The idea of losing freedom really scared me. The zoo does make <mark style="color:blue;">**conservation**</mark> efforts and <mark style="color:blue;">**educate**</mark> visitors about animals, but that does not necessarily make it an <mark style="color:blue;">**ideal**</mark> place for animals to live. The visit to the zoo not only taught me to be <mark style="color:blue;">**observant**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**of**</mark> the animals but also led me to <mark style="color:blue;">**ponder on**</mark> the rights of the zoo animals.

1. Ask anyone, and they'll tell you I'm <mark style="color:blue;">**as amiable as can be**</mark>. That being said, there are a select few people who make me <mark style="color:blue;">**fly into a rage**</mark>, and Becky Chen is among them. <mark style="color:blue;">**Snobbish**</mark> and self-important, Becky <mark style="color:blue;">**looks down on**</mark> anyone who won't <mark style="color:blue;">**elevate**</mark> her status in life. That's why my heart <mark style="color:blue;">**sank**</mark> when our science teacher <mark style="color:blue;">**paired us up**</mark> for a presentation one day.
2. I tried to be <mark style="color:blue;">**gracious**</mark> when I sat down next to Becky. <mark style="color:blue;">**In return**</mark>, she looked at me as one might regard a cockroach and immediately took out her phone, refusing to communicate or <mark style="color:blue;">**do her share**</mark> of the work. I <mark style="color:blue;">**eventually**</mark> had to tell her that she needed to <mark style="color:blue;">**contribute**</mark>, or I'd let the teacher know she had <mark style="color:blue;">**slacked off**</mark>, and she'd receive no credit. She <mark style="color:blue;">**reluctantly**</mark> wrote her part after that. It took patience to deal with her attitude, but I was glad I didn't <mark style="color:blue;">**lose my cool**</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">**that**</mark> we were able to get the job done.

1. Dear Classmates,\
   In recent weeks, I <mark style="color:blue;">**have discovered**</mark> the floor of our classroom is often <mark style="color:blue;">**littered with**</mark> trash such as tissues, empty plastic bottles, and even lunch <mark style="color:blue;">**leftovers**</mark>. I don't know why, but I figure some of us <mark style="color:blue;">**must have thrown them away**</mark> carelessly.
2. In addition, the walls of our classroom <mark style="color:blue;">**have been marked**</mark> with <mark style="color:blue;">**stains**</mark> from coffee, tea, or juice. This is an <mark style="color:blue;">**eyesore**</mark> not only for us but for our teachers as well! Our classroom is the place <mark style="color:blue;">**where**</mark> we study and interact almost <mark style="color:blue;">**on a daily basis**</mark>. We don't want to turn it into a <mark style="color:blue;">**pigsty**</mark>!
3. <mark style="color:blue;">**As the leader of our class cleanup team**</mark>, I would like all of you to help me keep our classroom clean and <mark style="color:blue;">**tidy**</mark>. All you have to do is <mark style="color:blue;">**take care**</mark> not to leave any trash or lunch <mark style="color:blue;">**leftovers**</mark> on the floor and <mark style="color:blue;">**sort out**</mark> your trash for recycling.
4. If every one of us <mark style="color:blue;">**pitches in**</mark>, I'm sure we will make our classroom a better place for us to focus on our studies. By the way, I need some volunteers to <mark style="color:blue;">**assist**</mark> me in repainting the walls on the weekend. Contact me if any of you are interested. Let's work together to make our classroom the <mark style="color:blue;">**pride**</mark> of the school.

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**With the advance of**</mark> the Internet and smartphones, more and more people are using <mark style="color:blue;">**social networking media**</mark> and constantly checking their friends' <mark style="color:blue;">**updates**</mark>. Apart from that, there has been a trend of making <mark style="color:blue;">**film clips**</mark> and posting them on Youtube or other media. There, youtubers or <mark style="color:blue;">**Internet celebrities**</mark> share their life experiences, teach what they know, <mark style="color:blue;">**comment on**</mark> politics or social <mark style="color:blue;">**phenomena**</mark> or simply do something crazy.
2. They become popular when the audience find them attractive, humorous or simply <mark style="color:blue;">**entertaining**</mark>. In this <mark style="color:blue;">**fast-paced**</mark> Internet world, youtubers or <mark style="color:blue;">**Internet celebrities**</mark> can <mark style="color:blue;">**grab**</mark> people's attention and interact with them well within a minute. In this way, viewers will <mark style="color:blue;">**subscribe to**</mark> their channels and continue to follow them.
3. <mark style="color:blue;">**As far as I am concerned**</mark>, the <mark style="color:blue;">**impact**</mark> of youtubers and Internet celebrities is worrying. Some of the Internet celebrities do not have <mark style="color:blue;">**a sense of morality**</mark>. They might do something <mark style="color:blue;">**obscene**</mark> or <mark style="color:blue;">**against**</mark> the law just to make their films <mark style="color:blue;">**sensational**</mark>. Other youtubers may show no respect to people from other countries and <mark style="color:blue;">**deliberately**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**discriminate**</mark> them. What's depressing is that such films <mark style="color:blue;">**should have been**</mark> "shared" a million times.
4. Take a recent youtube clip for example. In the film, the youtuber visited Hong Kong. After he arrived at the airport, he kept <mark style="color:blue;">**criticizing**</mark> Chinese people, including their English language ability, and their behavior. He even stopped a passerby and asked where he could find a prostitute. When this youtuber was <mark style="color:blue;">**condemned**</mark> in the TV media, not only did he feel no regret, but he also refused to <mark style="color:blue;">**take down**</mark> the film. It seems that youtubers tend to feel <mark style="color:blue;">**conceited**</mark> when they have too many followers. Therefore, there should be more <mark style="color:blue;">**regulations**</mark> or <mark style="color:blue;">**restrictions**</mark> to make sure youtubers and Internet celebrities behave properly.

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**To Whom It May Concern,**</mark>\
   I am writing to <mark style="color:blue;">**apply to**</mark> National Taiwan University's <mark style="color:blue;">**undergraduate**</mark> program in the Department of Anthropology for the fall 2020 <mark style="color:blue;">**term**</mark>. I believe that my <mark style="color:blue;">**background**</mark> in, knowledge of, and <mark style="color:blue;">**passion for**</mark> the study of human cultures make me uniquely <mark style="color:blue;">**qualified**</mark> to <mark style="color:blue;">**be admitted to**</mark> your program.
2. <mark style="color:blue;">**In particular**</mark>, I have <mark style="color:blue;">**nurtured**</mark> a <mark style="color:blue;">**lifelong**</mark> interest in the <mark style="color:blue;">**indigenous**</mark> cultures of Taiwan. My father's family is from the Atayal <mark style="color:blue;">**tribe**</mark>, and I was <mark style="color:blue;">**raised**</mark> with <mark style="color:blue;">**intimate**</mark> knowledge of and participation in Atayal culture as a result. My relatives taught me to be proud of this part of my <mark style="color:blue;">**identity**</mark>.
3. <mark style="color:blue;">**As**</mark> a student of your program, my <mark style="color:blue;">**aim**</mark> will be not only to study Taiwan's <mark style="color:blue;">**indigenous**</mark> roots, but also to <mark style="color:blue;">**promote**</mark> our island's <mark style="color:blue;">**cultural variety**</mark> both <mark style="color:blue;">**at home and abroad**</mark>. Your program attracts my interest because I know its teaching <mark style="color:blue;">**staff**</mark> and student body share the same goals. I hope my application <mark style="color:blue;">**demonstrates**</mark> that I am an <mark style="color:blue;">**ideal candidate**</mark> to join your program.\
   <mark style="color:blue;">**Sincerely,**</mark>\

1. Jenny <mark style="color:blue;">**was**</mark> very <mark style="color:blue;">**fond of**</mark> fast food: hamburgers, fried chickens and French fries <mark style="color:blue;">**coupled with**</mark> a glass of coke were her favorite. She loved them so much that she often ate them for dinners. One day, she stood in front of a mirror and found many <mark style="color:blue;">**pimples**</mark> on her face. Besides, she also found that her uniforms looked very <mark style="color:blue;">**tight**</mark> on her. She had a sudden awakening that the fast food she had was so <mark style="color:blue;">**greasy**</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">**high-calorie**</mark> that it <mark style="color:blue;">**led to**</mark> the <mark style="color:blue;">**pimples**</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">**weight gain**</mark>.
2. She felt very upset about this. Especially, when she was <mark style="color:blue;">**in the presence of**</mark> the boy she <mark style="color:blue;">**had a crush on**</mark>, she felt extremely embarrassed and <mark style="color:blue;">**ill at ease**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**With**</mark> this realization, Jenny decided to <mark style="color:blue;">**take regular exercise**</mark> so that she could lose weight as soon as possible. Moreover, she would eat light meals and cleanse her skin more often to help her skin <mark style="color:blue;">**go back to normal**</mark>. Right at this moment, she knew that she was <mark style="color:blue;">**what**</mark> she ate.

1. One day, on his way to work, Andy got a <mark style="color:blue;">**news alert**</mark> on his phone. It warned him that milk supplies had been found to be <mark style="color:blue;">**contaminated**</mark> and that the milk on sale now was <mark style="color:blue;">**unfit**</mark> to <mark style="color:blue;">**consume**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**On learning this**</mark>, Andy was <mark style="color:blue;">**stunned**</mark> and sent the message to several of his friends right away (= <mark style="color:blue;">**in no time**</mark>).
2. They all felt shocked and helped <mark style="color:blue;">**spread**</mark> the news <mark style="color:blue;">**in turn**</mark>. Soon, no one would <mark style="color:blue;">**dare**</mark> to buy milk. To get people to buy milk again, some supermarkets tried to lower its price to 50% <mark style="color:blue;">**off**</mark>, but it was <mark style="color:blue;">**in vain**</mark>. With the <mark style="color:blue;">**dairy industry**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**suffering**</mark> such a <mark style="color:blue;">**severe economic blow**</mark>, the government decided to <mark style="color:blue;">**step in**</mark>. The <mark style="color:blue;">**authorities**</mark> responsible for food safety announced that a full <mark style="color:blue;">**investigation**</mark> would take place and claimed that they would <mark style="color:blue;">**track down**</mark> the source of the problem.
3. A lot of milk <mark style="color:blue;">**samples**</mark> were tested for <mark style="color:blue;">**contamination**</mark>, and the <mark style="color:blue;">**facilities**</mark> of every dairy farm were carefully <mark style="color:blue;">**inspected**</mark>. When the source of <mark style="color:blue;">**contamination**</mark> was found, the milk companies <mark style="color:blue;">**apologized**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**assuring**</mark> the public <mark style="color:blue;">**of**</mark> their products' future safety. In time, people's confidence in milk was <mark style="color:blue;">**restored**</mark> and sales increased.

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**Live-streaming**</mark> technology is a <mark style="color:blue;">**relatively**</mark> new part of our social media. <mark style="color:blue;">**Now that**</mark> almost everybody has a video camera on their phone or computer, it's easy for people to <mark style="color:blue;">**live-stream**</mark> themselves while doing any activity, like playing video games or having a meal. Some people don't want to <mark style="color:blue;">**broadcast**</mark> in this way, because they <mark style="color:blue;">**prefer to**</mark> keep things private and don't like others to see the details of their lives.
2. For others, <mark style="color:blue;">**though**</mark>, it offers an amazing opportunity. It can help them earn some additional <mark style="color:blue;">**income**</mark> by having <mark style="color:blue;">**product placement**</mark> in their videos. It can even be some people's main job. The fact <mark style="color:blue;">**that**</mark> ordinary people can <mark style="color:blue;">**live-stream**</mark> themselves can be either good or bad at different times. On the <mark style="color:blue;">**positive**</mark> side of things, there's <mark style="color:blue;">**value**</mark> in the authenticity that <mark style="color:blue;">**live-streaming**</mark> offers. You can see into someone else's life and feel like you're communicating with a real person.
3. <mark style="color:blue;">**On the other hand**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**the lack of**</mark> centralization can be a <mark style="color:blue;">**negative**</mark> when it leads to misleading or incorrect information being repeated and <mark style="color:blue;">**promoted**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**Streamers**</mark> can <mark style="color:blue;">**resort to**</mark> outrageous or harmful behavior to attract more viewers, and they often have little or not <mark style="color:blue;">**supervision**</mark>. This behavior sometimes influences others to do <mark style="color:blue;">**risky**</mark> things. It seems that live-streaming is <mark style="color:blue;">**here to stay**</mark>, but whether it's good or bad <mark style="color:blue;">**is up to us**</mark> to use it responsibly.

1. This <mark style="color:blue;">**chart**</mark> shows the <mark style="color:blue;">**amount**</mark> of time per day high school students from various countries spend in lass. It <mark style="color:blue;">**appears**</mark> that students in Taiwan spend more time in class than <mark style="color:blue;">**those**</mark> from the US, Germany, and Finland. Finnish students only spend five hours a day at school, <mark style="color:blue;">**while**</mark> students from Germany and the US spend 6 and 6.5 hours a day there, <mark style="color:blue;">**respectively**</mark>. Taiwanese students spend the most hours, <mark style="color:blue;">**on average**</mark> 9.5 hours a day, in school.
2. For me, <mark style="color:blue;">**there's no doubt**</mark> that Taiwanese students spend too long at school each day. Finnish students only spend five hours a day at school, yet their education system is <mark style="color:blue;">**highly praised**</mark>. This <mark style="color:blue;">**suggests**</mark> that students don't need to spend long hours at school to get a good education. What's more, longer hours mean Taiwanese students have less time for <mark style="color:blue;">**extracurricular activities**</mark>, such as sports or music.
3. This <mark style="color:blue;">**robs**</mark> them <mark style="color:blue;">**of**</mark> the opportunity to develop interests outside of schoolwork. <mark style="color:blue;">**In addition**</mark>, long school hours <mark style="color:blue;">**likely**</mark> mean not only more tests but also more pressure for students. Both of these <mark style="color:blue;">**factors**</mark> could cause them to lose their <mark style="color:blue;">**enthusiasm for**</mark> learning. It's clear that Taiwan's education system <mark style="color:blue;">**still leaves much to be desired**</mark>.

1. Dear Mr. Chen,\
   I am writing to you about something I <mark style="color:blue;">**observed**</mark> during yesterday's English test. David, the student next to me, was <mark style="color:blue;">**cheating**</mark> by looking at a book he had on his knees. He <mark style="color:blue;">**had taken out**</mark> the book with the <mark style="color:blue;">**intention**</mark> of copying the answers. I couldn't believe my eyes. I looked around, but no one else seemed to <mark style="color:blue;">**have noticed**</mark> what he was doing.
2. This made it hard for me to <mark style="color:blue;">**accuse**</mark> him, as he could just <mark style="color:blue;">**deny**</mark> it. I know this sort <mark style="color:blue;">**of**</mark> behavior is wrong, so I've decided to write this email to inform you of it. It is unbelievable that a student would <mark style="color:blue;">**cheat on a test**</mark>. It shows that David is not <mark style="color:blue;">**taking responsibility for**</mark> his work by studying hard like the rest of the class.
3. However, David may be under a lot of pressure at home, or he <mark style="color:blue;">**might have cheated**</mark> for some other reasons that I know nothing about. This is the first time I've caught him <mark style="color:blue;">**doing**</mark> it. Whatever the reason is, I think this kind of behavior should be <mark style="color:blue;">**curbed**</mark>, as it may have <mark style="color:blue;">**negative**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**consequences**</mark> for him. Perhaps you could talk with him, explain to him why his actions were wrong, and help him with any problems hey may have.\
   &#x20;                                                                                                                                  <mark style="color:blue;">**Yours sincerely,**</mark>\
   &#x20;                                                                                                                                                     Linda

1. I recently learned not to run from my mistakes. The night before some important exams, I went to my room with the <mark style="color:blue;">**intention**</mark> of studying hard. Then, my brother came in with a new video game. It looked really <mark style="color:blue;">**thrilling**</mark>, so I decided to play it with him for a while. However, the time got away from me, and <mark style="color:blue;">**I didn't go to bed until late**</mark>.
2. <mark style="color:blue;">**The**</mark> next morning, I felt tired and my head was <mark style="color:blue;">**spinning**</mark> as I took my exams. Though I'd studied <mark style="color:blue;">**on**</mark> other nights, <mark style="color:blue;">**lack of sleep**</mark> kept me from <mark style="color:blue;">**focusing on**</mark> the questions. When I got my grades for the exams, I was shocked. I'd received my poorest grades ever in every subject. <mark style="color:blue;">**Panicking**</mark>, I decided to hide the <mark style="color:blue;">**report card**</mark> in my clothes drawer.
3. I thought <mark style="color:blue;">**as long as**</mark> my parents didn't find it, I'd be able to <mark style="color:blue;">**cover up**</mark> my poor performance. However, <mark style="color:blue;">**against**</mark> my expectations, my <mark style="color:blue;">**homeroom teacher**</mark> called my parents and told them what had happened. My parents were <mark style="color:blue;">**furious**</mark> that I <mark style="color:blue;">**had hidden**</mark> my grades and punished me by taking away my <mark style="color:blue;">**allowance**</mark> for three months. I <mark style="color:blue;">**should have faced up to**</mark> my mistake at once and accepted the <mark style="color:blue;">**consequences**</mark>. I regret <mark style="color:blue;">**having hidden**</mark> things, as it only made matters <mark style="color:blue;">**worse**</mark>.

1. Many people have become so <mark style="color:blue;">**reliant on**</mark> social media that if their beloved apps <mark style="color:blue;">**malfunction**</mark>, they <mark style="color:blue;">**go nuts**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**As far as I am concerned**</mark>, this is an unhealthy reaction that shows just how <mark style="color:blue;">**addicted to**</mark> social media they <mark style="color:blue;">**are**</mark>. It would be <mark style="color:blue;">**far**</mark> better if they were able to <mark style="color:blue;">**keep things in perspective**</mark>.
2. That is, people should realize that in the grand scheme of things, <mark style="color:blue;">**losing access to**</mark> Facebook or Instagram is not a serious problem. Moreover, there are better things that people can <mark style="color:blue;">**occupy themselves with**</mark>, such as reading fiction or <mark style="color:blue;">**engaging in**</mark> a worthwhile hobby. While I'm not a <mark style="color:blue;">**social media addict**</mark>, I know people who are. <mark style="color:blue;">**Not having access to**</mark> Facebook or Instagram can seem like a major <mark style="color:blue;">**inconvenience**</mark> for them.
3. Take my friend Linda for example. When Instagram was <mark style="color:blue;">**down**</mark> a few months ago, she lost it. It looked like her whole world <mark style="color:blue;">**caved in**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**Obviously**</mark>, it was a complete <mark style="color:blue;">**overreaction**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**Essentially**</mark>, I would <mark style="color:blue;">**characterize**</mark> her problem as an <mark style="color:blue;">**obsession**</mark>. When an internet addiction starts to <mark style="color:blue;">**interfere**</mark> too much <mark style="color:blue;">**with**</mark> one's life, it is probably best for that person to <mark style="color:blue;">**seek**</mark> some help. After all, <mark style="color:blue;">**there's more to life than social media**</mark>.

1. This year, my friends and I went camping <mark style="color:blue;">**in celebration of**</mark> Jenny's birthday. We went into the woods to find our <mark style="color:blue;">**campsite**</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">**set up**</mark> our tents. The night was dark except for the <mark style="color:blue;">**dim**</mark> light of the moon. Ken started to tell a story he had heard about theses woods ─ the ghost of a woman who had gotten lost in them still <mark style="color:blue;">**wandered**</mark> between the trees at night.
2. She would <mark style="color:blue;">**drag**</mark> hikers deep into the woods, and they would never be seen again. The story <mark style="color:blue;">**sent the shivers down our spine**</mark>. Suddenly, Ken <mark style="color:blue;">**switched of**</mark>**f** his flashlight. Everything was <mark style="color:blue;">**swallowed**</mark> by darkness. <mark style="color:blue;">**Terrified**</mark>, Jenny <mark style="color:blue;">**screamed at the top of her lungs**</mark>!
3. <mark style="color:blue;">**Before long**</mark>, Ken <mark style="color:blue;">**switched**</mark> his flashlight back on. George and I had brought out the presents while it was dark. We started to sing "Happy Birthday" to Jenny. She was <mark style="color:blue;">**taken aback**</mark> at first, but she <mark style="color:blue;">**was relieved**</mark> that it was just a <mark style="color:blue;">**harmless prank**</mark>. We were sure she would never forget this birthday.

1. In my opinion, those with <mark style="color:blue;">**severe depression**</mark> might consider <mark style="color:blue;">**euthanasia**</mark>. Some people's emotional <mark style="color:blue;">**agony**</mark> is so <mark style="color:blue;">**persistent**</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">**unbearable**</mark> that they'd rather die than <mark style="color:blue;">**cope with**</mark> it any longer. For them, there is nothing more <mark style="color:blue;">**frustrating**</mark> than struggling <mark style="color:blue;">**against**</mark> an invisible <mark style="color:blue;">**long-standing**</mark> enemy that makes every <mark style="color:blue;">**aspect**</mark> of their lives <mark style="color:blue;">**spin**</mark> out of control.
2. Still, whether we should use euthanasia to help these people end their <mark style="color:blue;">**suffering**</mark> remains a <mark style="color:blue;">**highly controversial**</mark> topic. While <mark style="color:blue;">**being sympathetic to**</mark> their pain, we must also do our utmost to <mark style="color:blue;">**ensure**</mark> they <mark style="color:blue;">**seek**</mark> professional care before making any <mark style="color:blue;">**irreversible**</mark> decisions.
3. I'm not <mark style="color:blue;">**against**</mark> the idea of legal euthanasia, but I think it should <mark style="color:blue;">**serve as**</mark> a <mark style="color:blue;">**last resort**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**to**</mark> finally escape pain that cannot be cured. <mark style="color:blue;">**For one thing**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**tight**</mark> restrictions should be established so that we can make sure that those who receive euthanasia are people who are truly <mark style="color:blue;">**beyond**</mark> help.
4. <mark style="color:blue;">**For another**</mark>, people who <mark style="color:blue;">**seek**</mark> euthanasia must <mark style="color:blue;">**go through**</mark> a series of careful steps with the assistance of a medical expert to ensure it is what they sincerely want. If euthanasia were too quick and easy, it could <mark style="color:blue;">**end up being abused**</mark> as the "<mark style="color:blue;">**easy way out**</mark>" which people might choose without careful thought.

1. Last Sunday, my dad drove us to our local supermarket to <mark style="color:blue;">**pick up some groceries**</mark>. Although shopping is a <mark style="color:blue;">**routine affair**</mark>, this outing was quite memorable and <mark style="color:blue;">**dramatic**</mark>. The drama actually <mark style="color:blue;">**unfolded**</mark> before we even entered the supermarket. After we parked our car, we were shocked to find that there was an <mark style="color:blue;">**infant**</mark> left alone in the back seat of the car next to ours. She was <mark style="color:blue;">**crying her eyes out**</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">**screaming at the top of her lungs**</mark>.
2. <mark style="color:blue;">**Worried about**</mark> the safety of the infant, my dad tried to open the door, but it was locked, so my mom called the police immediately. Five minutes later, a police officer arrived. <mark style="color:blue;">**Seeing**</mark> that the infant's face had started to turn red, he decided to break the window and get the baby out. When the mother returned to the car, she was surprised to see that people gathered around her car and <mark style="color:blue;">**that**</mark> her car window was broken. The police officer <mark style="color:blue;">**scolded**</mark> her and warned her that she should never leave her baby <mark style="color:blue;">**unattended**</mark> in the car, especially <mark style="color:blue;">**on**</mark> a hot day <mark style="color:blue;">**with**</mark> the windows closed. He even gave her a <mark style="color:blue;">**ticket**</mark>. After this <mark style="color:blue;">**incident**</mark>, I believe the mother will never make such an <mark style="color:blue;">**appalling**</mark> mistake again.

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**It is not uncommon**</mark> for high school students to <mark style="color:blue;">**take on**</mark> part-time jobs to earn a bit of cash. As the <mark style="color:blue;">**bar graph demonstrates**</mark>, many students─<mark style="color:blue;">**roughly**</mark> 50%─prefer to work either at a restaurant or at a business owned by a family member. A <mark style="color:blue;">**significant**</mark> number also choose to work at cram schools or doing some type of <mark style="color:blue;">**delivery**</mark> work.
2. <mark style="color:blue;">**Least attractive**</mark> for teens, <mark style="color:blue;">**judging**</mark> from the <mark style="color:blue;">**survey**</mark> results, is working at a convenience store. If I <mark style="color:blue;">**were to**</mark> take a part-time job, I would <mark style="color:blue;">**opt to**</mark> work at my family's business. Bosses can be very <mark style="color:blue;">**demanding**</mark> and may not care about their <mark style="color:blue;">**staff**</mark> much, <mark style="color:blue;">**whereas**</mark> my family would look out for my <mark style="color:blue;">**best interests**</mark>.
3. I believe I would receive a fair <mark style="color:blue;">**wage**</mark> and learn a lot by working with my relatives. In addition, I know they wouldn't make me do anything that might <mark style="color:blue;">**threaten**</mark> my safety. Thus, <mark style="color:blue;">**in terms of**</mark> what type of part-time job I would <mark style="color:blue;">**pursue**</mark>, my choice <mark style="color:blue;">**coincides with**</mark> those made by many other high-schoolers.

1. One Saturday afternoon, I went swimming in an indoor pool. After doing 50 <mark style="color:blue;">**laps**</mark>, I went back home. As I opened the door and entered the living room, I noticed a box of cookies <mark style="color:blue;">**lying**</mark> on the coffee table. Because I was quite hungry, I opened the <mark style="color:blue;">**lid**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**without hesitation**</mark> and began to <mark style="color:blue;">**pig out**</mark>.
2. When my dad found out about this, he looked very angry and said the box of cookies <mark style="color:blue;">**was meant to**</mark> be a present for one of his <mark style="color:blue;">**clients**</mark>. At first, I thought it was <mark style="color:blue;">**no big deal**</mark> to eat just a few cookies, but my dad's look <mark style="color:blue;">**indicated**</mark> that I had made a big mistake by not asking for <mark style="color:blue;">**permission**</mark>. Later that night, <mark style="color:blue;">**on**</mark> my older sister's advice, I <mark style="color:blue;">**plucked up**</mark> the courage to admit my mistake and <mark style="color:blue;">**apologized to**</mark> him.
3. I even said that I would pay <mark style="color:blue;">**for**</mark> a new box of cookies <mark style="color:blue;">**out of**</mark> my own pocket. Hearing my <mark style="color:blue;">**sincere apology**</mark>, my dad nodded <mark style="color:blue;">**in approval**</mark> and forgave me. He also <mark style="color:blue;">**praised**</mark> me for my <mark style="color:blue;">**willingness**</mark> to <mark style="color:blue;">**fix**</mark> the mistake. From what happened, I've learned that we should <mark style="color:blue;">**take responsibility for**</mark> anything we do wrong.

1. These days, many people are choosing to take university courses online instead of in a classroom. One <mark style="color:blue;">**undeniable advantage**</mark> to this <mark style="color:blue;">**approach**</mark> is that online courses are <mark style="color:blue;">**available**</mark> at a time and place that work well for the student. This especially <mark style="color:blue;">**benefits**</mark> those who lack the time to <mark style="color:blue;">**attend**</mark> classes <mark style="color:blue;">**in person**</mark> or who don't have a university in their area.
2. <mark style="color:blue;">**Access to education**</mark> is <mark style="color:blue;">**expanded**</mark> to include anyone with an <mark style="color:blue;">**Internet connection**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**As for myself**</mark>, I still prefer taking classes in the traditional way. I <mark style="color:blue;">**value**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**face-to-face interaction**</mark>.
3. Even though we can discuss things with the <mark style="color:blue;">**instructor**</mark> through email when taking online courses, it's not as <mark style="color:blue;">**efficient**</mark> as being able to interact with them <mark style="color:blue;">**in person**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**The same goes for**</mark> holding group discussions with classmates. In addition, <mark style="color:blue;">**debating**</mark> with my <mark style="color:blue;">**peers**</mark> in a classroom helps <mark style="color:blue;">**spark**</mark> new ideas. Online courses can't provide these learning opportunities as easily as traditional courses can.

1. Fake news <mark style="color:blue;">**deliberately**</mark> tries to <mark style="color:blue;">**mislead**</mark> people <mark style="color:blue;">**into**</mark> believing something is true when it actually isn't. Generally speaking, fake news appears online and looks like a <mark style="color:blue;">**genuine**</mark> news report. I once <mark style="color:blue;">**got fooled**</mark> by a news <mark style="color:blue;">**article**</mark> I read in a Facebook group, in which the writer claimed that a politician I didn't like was <mark style="color:blue;">**accepting bribes**</mark>.
2. I shared it on my own Facebook page, but <mark style="color:blue;">**no sooner had I done so than people pointed out**</mark> the story was obviously false. I felt embarrassed, and since then I've followed the <mark style="color:blue;">**motto**</mark> that I <mark style="color:blue;">**cannot be too careful**</mark> when it comes to online information.
3. There are several ways to <mark style="color:blue;">**spot**</mark> fake news. First, consider the <mark style="color:blue;">**source**</mark>. If the <mark style="color:blue;">**article**</mark> doesn't come from a real or <mark style="color:blue;">**reliable**</mark> news site, it's likely fake. You can also use the Internet to search for the author's name to find out whether they're a real <mark style="color:blue;">**journalist**</mark>. If you have any doubts about a story, don't share it online. What's more, if you see other people sharing fake news, you can leave a <mark style="color:blue;">**comment**</mark> with <mark style="color:blue;">**proof**</mark> that it's fake. In these ways, you can <mark style="color:blue;">**prevent**</mark> fake news <mark style="color:blue;">**from**</mark> spreading.

1. Many people in Taiwan visit fortune-tellers <mark style="color:blue;">**with a view to**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**finding**</mark> out what the future <mark style="color:blue;">**holds**</mark> for them. Others, however, don't believe in this kind of thing. I think one reason for its <mark style="color:blue;">**popularity**</mark> is that it can provide some guidance when someone is <mark style="color:blue;">**anxious about**</mark> their future or has a <mark style="color:blue;">**crucial**</mark> decision to make.
2. Another reason is that it works as a kind of <mark style="color:blue;">**counseling**</mark> service. People can go there to talk about the choices or difficulties they <mark style="color:blue;">**are confronted with**</mark> and receive not only <mark style="color:blue;">**comfort**</mark> but also a <mark style="color:blue;">**positive response**</mark> that makes them feel they could make a right decision. If I am faced with a <mark style="color:blue;">**dilemma concerning**</mark> my future after high school, I may visit a fortune teller.
3. <mark style="color:blue;">**For one thing**</mark>, I am <mark style="color:blue;">**curious about**</mark> how fortune telling works, and I want to know whether there is really someone who might know things about me and <mark style="color:blue;">**predict**</mark> my future accurately. <mark style="color:blue;">**For another**</mark>, talking to the fortune teller about my problem might help me find a solution myself. Getting my fortune <mark style="color:blue;">**told**</mark> doesn't <mark style="color:blue;">**commit**</mark> me <mark style="color:blue;">**to**</mark> anything, so <mark style="color:blue;">**there's no harm**</mark> in listening at another person's opinion as I try to make up my mind.

1. In February, Taiwanese news <mark style="color:blue;">**sources**</mark> reported that the cost of toilet paper would probably rise <mark style="color:blue;">**by**</mark> 10-30% in the coming months. Hearing this, people <mark style="color:blue;">**swarmed**</mark> to stores all over Taiwan to buy large <mark style="color:blue;">**quantities**</mark> of toilet paper. As soon as the stores opened, <mark style="color:blue;">**herds**</mark> of people <mark style="color:blue;">**rushed**</mark> to the toilet paper shelves like animals fighting for food.
2. <mark style="color:blue;">**In spite of**</mark> the clerks' best efforts to <mark style="color:blue;">**meet public demand**</mark>, the shelves quickly <mark style="color:blue;">**emptied**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**Meanwhile**</mark>, people's <mark style="color:blue;">**carts**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**were piled high**</mark> with <mark style="color:blue;">**bundles**</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">**bundles**</mark> of toilet paper. My family and I weren't as <mark style="color:blue;">**panicked**</mark> about the toilet paper news as other people were.
3. <mark style="color:blue;">**For one thing**</mark>, toilet paper isn't very expensive. Although the rising cost would affect our monthly <mark style="color:blue;">**expenses**</mark>, it wouldn't become a <mark style="color:blue;">**financial burden**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**For another**</mark>, my family only uses a limited <mark style="color:blue;">**amount**</mark> of toilet paper per day because we try not to use toilet paper for every little thing. When it comes to <mark style="color:blue;">**drying**</mark> our hands, for example, we use towels. <mark style="color:blue;">**For**</mark> these reasons and more, the price rise was not something for us to <mark style="color:blue;">**be concerned about**</mark>.

We have often <mark style="color:blue;">**confided in each other**</mark>, but an incident happened between us that almost <mark style="color:blue;">**ruined**</mark> our good relationship. One day she <mark style="color:blue;">**caught me reading**</mark> her diary <mark style="color:blue;">**on the sly**</mark>.
2. I did that <mark style="color:blue;">**out of curiosity**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**thinking**</mark> that as her little sister, I <mark style="color:blue;">**was entitled**</mark> to get a <mark style="color:blue;">**glimpse**</mark> into her inner thoughts. However, my sister didn't think so. She <mark style="color:blue;">**flew into a rage**</mark> as soon as she saw me <mark style="color:blue;">**browsing through**</mark> her diary. She even looked at me as if I <mark style="color:blue;">**were**</mark> a thief. I felt upset, too, because I thought she was just <mark style="color:blue;">**kicking up a fuss**</mark>. As a result, we were not <mark style="color:blue;">**on speaking terms**</mark> for a few days.
3. After I did some <mark style="color:blue;">**soul-searching**</mark>, I decided to admit to my <mark style="color:blue;">**wrongdoing**</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">**apologize to**</mark> her. I said that I had no right to <mark style="color:blue;">**pry into**</mark> her private life. I was terribly sorry, and I wouldn't do it again. She accepted my <mark style="color:blue;">**heartfelt apology**</mark> and gave me a hug. We finally <mark style="color:blue;">**made up**</mark>. From this incident, I have learned the lesson that we should respect other people's privacy no matter how close to each other we are.

1. Over winter vacation, I would like to <mark style="color:blue;">**attend**</mark> the camp called "Creativity and Originality of High School Students." As a person who <mark style="color:blue;">**tends to**</mark> follow others, I do not have the courage to lead, <mark style="color:blue;">**nor do I**</mark> come up with <mark style="color:blue;">**novel**</mark> or creative ideas. I usually provide nothing but <mark style="color:blue;">**conventional**</mark> ideas, which is why I want to learn how to <mark style="color:blue;">**boost**</mark> my creativity and <mark style="color:blue;">**ingenuity**</mark>.
2. Besides, in this highly <mark style="color:blue;">**competitive**</mark> world, if I cannot produce creative works or provide <mark style="color:blue;">**innovative**</mark> ideas for future employers, I <mark style="color:blue;">**am likely to**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**be overshadowed by**</mark> those who can bring creativity and <mark style="color:blue;">**originality**</mark> to the workplace. In my opinion, it would be great if the camp organizers arranged three major activities for the camp <mark style="color:blue;">**participants**</mark>.
3. First, they could introduce some <mark style="color:blue;">**abstract**</mark> theories about creativity with <mark style="color:blue;">**interactive**</mark> games. This would give students a deeper impression of the issue. They could also invite student speakers to share how they <mark style="color:blue;">**came up with**</mark> actual <mark style="color:blue;">**novel**</mark> ideas and <mark style="color:blue;">**intriguing**</mark> projects to inspire and <mark style="color:blue;">**motivate**</mark> us. In addition, I hope that all <mark style="color:blue;">**participants**</mark> will have a chance to <mark style="color:blue;">**display**</mark> their creativity and <mark style="color:blue;">**originality**</mark>. The camp organizers should hold a <mark style="color:blue;">**mock**</mark> contest in which students have to solve a real-life problem. I firmly believe that a camp offering these activities would truly have a lot to offer.

1. Johnny had always been a clever student and learned lessons easily. When he started high school, he <mark style="color:blue;">**assumed**</mark> this would continue to be the <mark style="color:blue;">**case**</mark>. As a result, he didn't pay attention in class and would even <mark style="color:blue;">**take naps**</mark> in the middle of <mark style="color:blue;">**lectures**</mark> from time to time. Then, <mark style="color:blue;">**on**</mark> the day of his first math exam, he <mark style="color:blue;">**overslept**</mark> and missed his bus.
2. He had to wait 20 minutes for the next one and was 15 minutes late when he arrived at school. With not enough time to complete the test, Johnny rushed and <mark style="color:blue;">**struggled to come up with**</mark> the correct answers. He knew he had done terribly, so <mark style="color:blue;">**it came as no surprise**</mark> that when the teacher handed back the <mark style="color:blue;">**graded**</mark> test, he saw he <mark style="color:blue;">**had failed**</mark>.
3. After that <mark style="color:blue;">**humbling**</mark> experience, Johnny realized he could not be so <mark style="color:blue;">**arrogant**</mark> about his classes and grades. <mark style="color:blue;">**Not only did he stay awake and alert**</mark> in all of his classes, <mark style="color:blue;">**but he reviewed**</mark> the lessons every night at home to make sure he would never receive a failing grade again.

1. It's very important for students to learn the skill of <mark style="color:blue;">**critical thinking**</mark>. This is the process of understanding, <mark style="color:blue;">**evaluating**</mark>, and <mark style="color:blue;">**applying**</mark> information in order to <mark style="color:blue;">**reach a conclusion**</mark>. Students should learn how to think <mark style="color:blue;">**critically**</mark> for several reasons.
2. <mark style="color:blue;">**For one thing**</mark>, it will help them <mark style="color:blue;">**with**</mark> their studies. They will be able to write better <mark style="color:blue;">**essays**</mark> and therefore get better grades. <mark style="color:blue;">**For another**</mark>, it has many <mark style="color:blue;">**practical**</mark> uses outside of school and college. Take this year's COVID-19 <mark style="color:blue;">**crisis**</mark>, for example. A lot of <mark style="color:blue;">**fake**</mark> news stories about this disease have been spread around, causing people to make poor decisions.
3. Some wasted money <mark style="color:blue;">**panic-buying**</mark> supplies; <mark style="color:blue;">**others**</mark> didn't act <mark style="color:blue;">**in**</mark> safe of <mark style="color:blue;">**sensible**</mark> ways because of what they heard. Critical thinking <mark style="color:blue;">**demands**</mark> that we understand all the facts before we act, and helps us <mark style="color:blue;">**recognize**</mark> the right course of action. This is just one reason why everyone needs to <mark style="color:blue;">**master**</mark> this <mark style="color:blue;">**practical**</mark> particular skill.

1. Failure is not the end, giving up is. This is my <mark style="color:blue;">**guiding principle**</mark> in life. Some people say their greatest passions is "<mark style="color:blue;">**in their blood**</mark>," or that it comes naturally to them. But for me, that's definitely <mark style="color:blue;">**not the case**</mark>. Though I dearly love dance, I've never been a naturally good dancer.
2. When I started taking <mark style="color:blue;">**hip-hop**</mark> classes as a kid, I had to practice for hours after class just to do the same moves my <mark style="color:blue;">**peers had mastered**</mark> in half the time. I found it <mark style="color:blue;">**extraordinarily**</mark> frustrating that I couldn't seem to get my body to obey my mind. I felt talentless and wanted to <mark style="color:blue;">**call it quits**</mark> until my coach <mark style="color:blue;">**took me aside**</mark> one day.
3. She <mark style="color:blue;">**praised**</mark> my tireless <mark style="color:blue;">**work ethic**</mark> and told me that I would do a <mark style="color:blue;">**solo**</mark> dance at our next <mark style="color:blue;">**showcase**</mark>! My <mark style="color:blue;">**outlook**</mark> changed after that as I looked back and realized how far I'd come. The more work I'd done, the more I'd improved, and now I was finally <mark style="color:blue;">**reaping the rewards**</mark>. If you ever <mark style="color:blue;">**feel like giving up**</mark>, just remember <mark style="color:blue;">**there is no failure except in not trying**</mark>.

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**Given**</mark> the choice of <mark style="color:blue;">**adopting**</mark> a hamster or a German shepherd, I would choose <mark style="color:blue;">**the latter**</mark>. In fact, I've always wanted to own a large dog like a German shepherd and have considered <mark style="color:blue;">**buying**</mark> one from a pet store. Thinking about it more closely, though, I believe choosing one from an animal <mark style="color:blue;">**shelter**</mark> is the better choice. Most <mark style="color:blue;">**shelters**</mark> are crowded, so I think giving one of those dogs a loving home is <mark style="color:blue;">**preferable**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**to purchasing**</mark> one from a commercial business. Moreover, the <mark style="color:blue;">**shelter**</mark> in the <mark style="color:blue;">**advertisement**</mark> is not far from my home.
2. In many ways, owning a dog is a bigger <mark style="color:blue;">**responsibility**</mark> than keeping a hamster, <mark style="color:blue;">**financially**</mark> and otherwise. <mark style="color:blue;">**For one thing**</mark>, I understand that I must <mark style="color:blue;">**make it a rule**</mark> to take Blaze out for a walk at least once a day, <mark style="color:blue;">**regardless of**</mark> the weather, even when I don't feel <mark style="color:blue;">**up to**</mark> it.
3. <mark style="color:blue;">**As**</mark> a responsible pet owner, I would make sure to pick up and <mark style="color:blue;">**discard**</mark> Blaze's <mark style="color:blue;">**poop**</mark> during our walks. I'm also <mark style="color:blue;">**aware**</mark> that a German shepherd <mark style="color:blue;">**consumes**</mark> a lot of dog food in a month, and I would need to be prepared for that <mark style="color:blue;">**financial obligation**</mark>. <mark style="color:blue;">**All in all**</mark>, though, it would be my great pleasure to have Blaze <mark style="color:blue;">**as**</mark> a pet.

1. I've always dreamed of becoming a <mark style="color:blue;">**pastry chef**</mark>. I have had a <mark style="color:blue;">**sweet tooth**</mark> since I was a child. I enjoy eating all sorts of desserts after almost every meal. To me, a meal is <mark style="color:blue;">**not complete**</mark> if it doesn't <mark style="color:blue;">**end with**</mark> apple pie or cheesecake. Whenever I pass by a <mark style="color:blue;">**bakery**</mark>, I cannot <mark style="color:blue;">**resist**</mark> going in and picking up some sweet <mark style="color:blue;">**treats**</mark> to <mark style="color:blue;">**delight**</mark> my <mark style="color:blue;">**taste buds**</mark>. I really admire <mark style="color:blue;">**pastry chefs**</mark> for their creativity and <mark style="color:blue;">**ingenuity**</mark>.
2. This is why I want to become a dessert <mark style="color:blue;">**chef**</mark>. What's more, <mark style="color:blue;">**pastry chefs**</mark> are very much <mark style="color:blue;">**in demand**</mark> everywhere nowadays, whether at <mark style="color:blue;">**bakeries**</mark>, restaurants, weddings, or even on <mark style="color:blue;">**cruise ships**</mark>. I joined a <mark style="color:blue;">**pastry cooking class**</mark> at my school this year. Every Wednesday evening after school, a retired <mark style="color:blue;">**chef**</mark> from a famous restaurant comes and teaches us how to make <mark style="color:blue;">**a variety of**</mark> fine desserts. In the beginning, he taught us a lot about food preparation like <mark style="color:blue;">**precise**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**measurements**</mark>, temperature control, and <mark style="color:blue;">**dough**</mark> rise times. In recent <mark style="color:blue;">**sessions**</mark>, he <mark style="color:blue;">**demonstrated**</mark> how to make <mark style="color:blue;">**pastry dough**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**from scratch**</mark> and had each of us prepare a batch.
3. Since gaining some <mark style="color:blue;">**practical**</mark> experience from him, I've begun to make some <mark style="color:blue;">**tarts**</mark> and cookies for my family and friends on weekends and have asked them to give me <mark style="color:blue;">**feedback**</mark>. I kept reminding myself to <mark style="color:blue;">**hone**</mark> my skills by <mark style="color:blue;">**constant**</mark> practice if I want to become a great <mark style="color:blue;">**chef**</mark>. In the future, perhaps, I may <mark style="color:blue;">**make a living**</mark> as a <mark style="color:blue;">**pastry chef**</mark> or I might just enjoy it as a side hobby.

1. Gary was walking home one day when he saw a stranger in front of him <mark style="color:blue;">**accidentally**</mark> drop his wallet. <mark style="color:blue;">**Upon picking it up**</mark>, Gary found a large <mark style="color:blue;">**amount**</mark> of cash inside. He <mark style="color:blue;">**couldn't help**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**but hesitate**</mark>. The man had already disappeared and in Gary's hands was more than enough money for him to buy the video game system he'd <mark style="color:blue;">**had his eye on**</mark> for months. In spite of his better judgement, Gary <mark style="color:blue;">**yielded to**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**temptation**</mark> and used the cash to buy the system.
2. A few days later, Gary was at home when the police showed up. Thanks to the city's <mark style="color:blue;">**surveillance**</mark> cameras, they were able to quickly discover what had happened to the man's wallet. Ashamed of his <mark style="color:blue;">**greedy**</mark> behavior, Gary <mark style="color:blue;">**burst into tears**</mark>. He <mark style="color:blue;">**handed**</mark> the wallet <mark style="color:blue;">**over to**</mark> the police, and his parents repaid the money he'd spent. While the police <mark style="color:blue;">**let Gary off**</mark> with a <mark style="color:blue;">**stern**</mark> warning, his parents punished him <mark style="color:blue;">**severely**</mark> and made him write a letter of <mark style="color:blue;">**apology**</mark> to the man. While doing so, Gary realized he'd learned an important lesson: anything worth <mark style="color:blue;">**owning**</mark> is worth <mark style="color:blue;">**earning**</mark>.

1. Though Leo's Kitchen and Phillip's Restaurant serve similar dishes, there are <mark style="color:blue;">**stark contrasts**</mark> between them. There are numerous customers dining at Leo's but the restaurant is <mark style="color:blue;">**in poor condition**</mark>. Flies <mark style="color:blue;">**hover**</mark> everywhere, and there are disgusting <mark style="color:blue;">**grease stains**</mark> on the floor. Phillip's, <mark style="color:blue;">**on the other hand**</mark>, offers a fantastic <mark style="color:blue;">**atmosphere**</mark>. It's clean and well-decorated, <mark style="color:blue;">**with**</mark> a finely made wooden screen and tasteful <mark style="color:blue;">**interior design**</mark>.
2. I <mark style="color:blue;">**prefer**</mark> Phillip's <mark style="color:blue;">**to**</mark> Leo's regardless of its higher food prices. I <mark style="color:blue;">**can't help but mistrust**</mark> any restaurant that doesn't <mark style="color:blue;">**maintain its cleanliness**</mark>. After all, diseases are easily <mark style="color:blue;">**spread**</mark> by flies and cockroaches. Besides, in my opinion, the quality of a restaurant's food <mark style="color:blue;">**has a lot to do with**</mark> the <mark style="color:blue;">**state**</mark> of the environment where it's prepared. While there are not enough customers at Phillip's to prove its dishes are truly tasty, this might be because the restaurant is newly opened and people don't know it well yet. <mark style="color:blue;">**All in all**</mark>, the <mark style="color:blue;">**hygiene**</mark> standards of a restaurant mean more to me than anything else.

1. Sally <mark style="color:blue;">**rushed**</mark> to the MRT station because she <mark style="color:blue;">**overslept**</mark> and didn't want to be late for school. As she passed by people, she <mark style="color:blue;">**couldn't help but notice**</mark> something unusual: the <mark style="color:blue;">**number**</mark> of people wearing masks was much greater than usual. When she <mark style="color:blue;">**stepped onto**</mark> an MRT car, she was shocked to see that almost every passenger was wearing a mask. She started to wonder if reports of poor air quality had <mark style="color:blue;">**prompted**</mark> so many people to cover their faces. As she checked her smartphone, she found that the news was mainly about a <mark style="color:blue;">**global epidemic**</mark>.
2. According to news reports, there was an <mark style="color:blue;">**outbreak**</mark> of a new virus in a big city in Asia. Officials were warning the public to protect themselves, especially <mark style="color:blue;">**the elderly**</mark> and those with weak <mark style="color:blue;">**immune system**</mark>. As time went by, more and more cases were <mark style="color:blue;">**reported**</mark> across the world. People <mark style="color:blue;">**panicked**</mark>, and governments <mark style="color:blue;">**took urgent measures**</mark> to get the <mark style="color:blue;">**epidemic**</mark> under control. <mark style="color:blue;">**On top of that**</mark>, demand for masks was at an <mark style="color:blue;">**all-time high**</mark>, and mask manufacturers just couldn't <mark style="color:blue;">**keep up**</mark>. As a result, people were <mark style="color:blue;">**restricted**</mark> in the number they could <mark style="color:blue;">**purchase**</mark>. There was nothing people could do <mark style="color:blue;">**but**</mark> pray the problem could be <mark style="color:blue;">**tackled**</mark> soon.

1. "California <mark style="color:blue;">**deadly**</mark> school shooting." "A criminal <mark style="color:blue;">**broke into**</mark> a school to <mark style="color:blue;">**sneak shots**</mark> of pupils." ... Such headlines of the past <mark style="color:blue;">**incidents**</mark> probably still <mark style="color:blue;">**haunt**</mark> many people nowadays, having caused wide <mark style="color:blue;">**concerns**</mark>. Many parents and students are <mark style="color:blue;">**anxious**</mark> that <mark style="color:blue;">**similar incidents**</mark> may occur again.
2. Actually, a school, <mark style="color:blue;">**in essence**</mark>, should be a safe place that perform the function of education and provide <mark style="color:blue;">**shelter**</mark>, since most students are too young to take care of themselves and <mark style="color:blue;">**hence**</mark> are in need of protection. A school should also be a paradise <mark style="color:blue;">**where**</mark> students can learn freely and <mark style="color:blue;">**gaily**</mark>. However, the current situation is <mark style="color:blue;">**far from**</mark> satisfaction.
3. <mark style="color:blue;">**From time to time**</mark>, campus security problems <mark style="color:blue;">**are reported**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**ranging**</mark> from the break-in of <mark style="color:blue;">**ill-intentioned intruders**</mark>, the <mark style="color:blue;">**unattended**</mark> playground equipment likes slides or swings, the buildings windows with <mark style="color:blue;">**rotted**</mark> bars, or even students of <mark style="color:blue;">**unstable**</mark> mental status and the <mark style="color:blue;">**hostile climate**</mark> that leads to <mark style="color:blue;">**bullying**</mark>.
4. <mark style="color:blue;">**As**</mark> a member of school, everyone <mark style="color:blue;">**on campus**</mark> has the responsibility to <mark style="color:blue;">**maintain**</mark> campus security. For example, schools <mark style="color:blue;">**ought to**</mark> have equipment <mark style="color:blue;">**checked regularly**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**install surveillance**</mark> cameras, keep the campus well <mark style="color:blue;">**lit**</mark>, and have guards increase the <mark style="color:blue;">**patrol**</mark> trips, so that criminals or <mark style="color:blue;">**hostile intruders**</mark> cannot possibly hide anywhere.
5. Besides, teachers should always <mark style="color:blue;">**be sensitive to**</mark> students' mental status and create a friendly environment. <mark style="color:blue;">**As for**</mark> students, we should always be watchful and <mark style="color:blue;">**alert to**</mark> any change and report the unusual case, <mark style="color:blue;">**if any**</mark>, to teachers or parents. It is also necessary that we should <mark style="color:blue;">**be**</mark> supportive and pay attention to the emotions and mental status of our classmates. Lastly, parents should play an <mark style="color:blue;">**indispensable**</mark> role in maintaining campus security. Parents should be sensitive to their children's behavior and always keep teachers <mark style="color:blue;">**informed of**</mark> any problem. With all these roles <mark style="color:blue;">**interwoven**</mark>, campus security is definitely <mark style="color:blue;">**enhanced**</mark>, providing students <mark style="color:blue;">**with**</mark> a safe and friendly environment.

1. One evening, James was at the basketball court <mark style="color:blue;">**working on his shooting skills**</mark> in preparation for a big game the next day. <mark style="color:blue;">**Despite his best efforts**</mark>, his performance was horrible. Disappointed <mark style="color:blue;">**at**</mark> himself, James decided to <mark style="color:blue;">**call it a night**</mark> and went home to get some rest. The next day, he arrived at the gym <mark style="color:blue;">**where**</mark> his teammates and <mark style="color:blue;">**opponents**</mark> were already warming up for the <mark style="color:blue;">**three-on-three**</mark> game.
2. They took their places on the court, and the game began. The teams were <mark style="color:blue;">**evenly matched**</mark> and by the end of the second half, the score <mark style="color:blue;">**was tied**</mark>. James' teammate passed him the ball. He <mark style="color:blue;">**glanced**</mark> up <mark style="color:blue;">**at**</mark> the game clock and saw that only one second remained. Standing all the way at the <mark style="color:blue;">**three-point line**</mark>, James doubted if he would <mark style="color:blue;">**make the basket**</mark>, but he knew he had to try. He <mark style="color:blue;">**took the shot**</mark> and watched as the ball <mark style="color:blue;">**sailed through the air**</mark>.
3. Surprisingly, it <mark style="color:blue;">**swished cleanly through the hoop**</mark>, and <mark style="color:blue;">**the crowd erupted into cheers**</mark>. At that moment, the <mark style="color:blue;">**buzzer**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**went off**</mark>. James <mark style="color:blue;">**sleepily**</mark> opened his eyes and realized that the sound wasn't a <mark style="color:blue;">**buzzer**</mark> at all; it was just his alarm clock. It had all been a dream.

1. Dear Yuni-Clothes <mark style="color:blue;">**Customer**</mark> Services, I am writing to express my <mark style="color:blue;">**dissatisfaction with**</mark> your online store. Last week, I ordered two T-shirts, a pair of gloves, and a wool hat from the store. This was not the first time I had used your online service, and <mark style="color:blue;">**on**</mark> every <mark style="color:blue;">**previous occasion**</mark>, the items I ordered <mark style="color:blue;">**had been delivered**</mark> on time and without any problems. This time, however, there was a number of <mark style="color:blue;">**issues**</mark>.
2. One of the T-shirts was the wrong size, <mark style="color:blue;">**while**</mark> the other was the wrong color. One of the gloves was <mark style="color:blue;">**badly torn**</mark>, and the hat was not delivered at all! I am very disappointed by this, especially <mark style="color:blue;">**given**</mark> how good your service has been up until now. I would like to <mark style="color:blue;">**exchange**</mark> the clothing items I received <mark style="color:blue;">**for**</mark> the correct styles. I would also <mark style="color:blue;">**appreciate**</mark> a <mark style="color:blue;">**full**</mark> or at least <mark style="color:blue;">**partial refund**</mark> on my original order to <mark style="color:blue;">**made up for**</mark> the mistake and the <mark style="color:blue;">**delay**</mark>. Please contact me <mark style="color:blue;">**at**</mark> 0941-676-222 for <mark style="color:blue;">**further details**</mark>.                                                                                                                              \

In order to save our environment from <mark style="color:blue;">**deteriorating**</mark>, never <mark style="color:blue;">**should we neglect**</mark> the following solutions <mark style="color:blue;">**to**</mark> the environmental problems. <mark style="color:blue;">**In the first place**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**the authorities concerned**</mark> must <mark style="color:blue;">**enact harsh laws**</mark> as soon as possible. Additionally, these laws <mark style="color:blue;">**ought to**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**be enforced**</mark> in and out. To put it differently, whoever pollutes the environment must <mark style="color:blue;">**be fined**</mark> or even punished. <mark style="color:blue;">**Last but not least**</mark>, the <mark style="color:blue;">**conception**</mark> of loving our Mother Earth must be <mark style="color:blue;">**instilled**</mark> into everyone. It is not until we come up to the three <mark style="color:blue;">**requirements that**</mark> the environment will be so wonderful that it can be called a paradise.

1. One day after an <mark style="color:blue;">**exhausting**</mark> day at school, I <mark style="color:blue;">**dragged my heavy feet**</mark> to the MRT station. <mark style="color:blue;">**Crowded as the train was**</mark>, I was lucky enough to <mark style="color:blue;">**spot**</mark> a <mark style="color:blue;">**vacant**</mark> seat, not noticing that it was <mark style="color:blue;">**priority**</mark> one. <mark style="color:blue;">**Upon sitting**</mark> down, I took out my cell phone, starting to check out my friends' facebook <mark style="color:blue;">**updates**</mark>. Though I could see an old man <mark style="color:blue;">**from the corner of my eyes**</mark>, I was too tired to <mark style="color:blue;">**raise**</mark> my head, <mark style="color:blue;">**not to mention yielding my seat**</mark> to him.
2. Several days later, while I was playing basketball during the <mark style="color:blue;">**recess**</mark>, I <mark style="color:blue;">**bumped into**</mark> another player, fell to the ground and <mark style="color:blue;">**sprained**</mark> my right <mark style="color:blue;">**ankle**</mark>. Unable to <mark style="color:blue;">**brace**</mark> myself with only one foot, I could only <mark style="color:blue;">**wobble**</mark> on a <mark style="color:blue;">**crutch**</mark>. The next day, on my way to school by MRT, <mark style="color:blue;">**to my disappointment**</mark>, nobody gave up their seat to me. Even the <mark style="color:blue;">**priority seat**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**was occupied**</mark> by a student <mark style="color:blue;">**of**</mark> my age.
3. Pretending to be busy <mark style="color:blue;">**memorizing English vocabulary**</mark>, she ignored my <mark style="color:blue;">**existence**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**intentionally**</mark> just as what I had done to the elderly man <mark style="color:blue;">**a couple of**</mark> days ago. With one hand holding the <mark style="color:blue;">**grip**</mark> and <mark style="color:blue;">**the other**</mark> on the <mark style="color:blue;">**crutch**</mark>, I almost fell several times. Not until then <mark style="color:blue;">**did**</mark> the true meaning of Confucius' teaching <mark style="color:blue;">**dawn on**</mark> me - "<mark style="color:blue;">**Do not do to others what you would not have others do to you**</mark>."

1. This <mark style="color:blue;">**bar graph**</mark> shows the kinds of business young adults in Taiwan would like to start as an <mark style="color:blue;">**alternative to**</mark> working for established companies. 70% of people <mark style="color:blue;">**surveyed**</mark> said they'd like to <mark style="color:blue;">**get involved with handicrafts**</mark>, making and selling their own goods. <mark style="color:blue;">**Meanwhile**</mark>, the <mark style="color:blue;">**notion**</mark> of owning a cafe was also popular, <mark style="color:blue;">**with**</mark> 62% of people <mark style="color:blue;">**showing interest**</mark>. Other popular choices were <mark style="color:blue;">**managing social media**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**running a mobile food truck**</mark>, working as a tour guide, and becoming an <mark style="color:blue;">**Internet celebrity**</mark>.
2. <mark style="color:blue;">**Given**</mark> the choice of these six careers, I'd like to be a tour guide. On large group tours organized by <mark style="color:blue;">**travel agencies**</mark>, everyone is always <mark style="color:blue;">**rushed**</mark> from place to place. If I <mark style="color:blue;">**were**</mark> my own boss, however, I <mark style="color:blue;">**could**</mark> give tours to <mark style="color:blue;">**individuals**</mark> or very small groups, and spend more time getting to know Taiwan. I'm <mark style="color:blue;">**passionate about**</mark> my country, and I love <mark style="color:blue;">**regaling**</mark> people <mark style="color:blue;">**with**</mark> its history, I also love Taiwanese <mark style="color:blue;">**cuisine**</mark>, so I could show everyone the best places to eat! That's why being a tour guide would be the perfect job for me.

1. Life is full of regrets, and I have more than my <mark style="color:blue;">**fair share**</mark>. For one, I wish that I <mark style="color:blue;">**had stood up for**</mark> Robert, a boy in my class, when he <mark style="color:blue;">**was being bullied**</mark>. Robert <mark style="color:blue;">**was**</mark> quite <mark style="color:blue;">**sensitive about being short**</mark>, and he got angry easily when other boys made fun of him<mark style="color:blue;">**, which**</mark> only made things worse. Though I <mark style="color:blue;">**personally never called Robert names**</mark> or <mark style="color:blue;">**took part in the bullying**</mark>, I never tried to <mark style="color:blue;">**put a stop to**</mark> it, either. I didn't want to bring the bullies' attention down on me, so I just stayed quiet and let it happen.
2. Later, Robert <mark style="color:blue;">**transferred to**</mark> another school. His life had become so <mark style="color:blue;">**miserable**</mark> that he couldn't stay at out school anymore. <mark style="color:blue;">**Had I supported him**</mark> and provided some friendship, he <mark style="color:blue;">**might have been happier**</mark> here. When I realized that, I promised myself that if I ever saw someone being bullied again, I wouldn't just keep my mouth shut. <mark style="color:blue;">**Instead**</mark>, I'd take action and make sure the <mark style="color:blue;">**bullying**</mark> stopped right there.

1. For years, Jack had sat on a <mark style="color:blue;">**dingy**</mark> street corner <mark style="color:blue;">**begging**</mark> for <mark style="color:blue;">**change**</mark>. Today, as usual, in the corner <mark style="color:blue;">**against**</mark> the wall he <mark style="color:blue;">**nestled**</mark> his head. Just then, a stranger walked <mark style="color:blue;">**past**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;">**scratching**</mark> an itch, not <mark style="color:blue;">**noticing**</mark> a NT$1,000 bill fall from his pocket onto the ground. However, Hack's eyes <mark style="color:blue;">**locked**</mark> onto it instantly. For him, the <mark style="color:blue;">**crumpled**</mark> banknote represented a week's <mark style="color:blue;">**worth**</mark> of meals, or maybe a pair of shoes.
2. But it wasn't <mark style="color:blue;">**rightfully**</mark> his, so he called out to the stranger. His heart <mark style="color:blue;">**sank**</mark> as the man turned around, but Jack smiled anyway as he gave up the money. The young man paused before <mark style="color:blue;">**grinning**</mark> widely. "You passed! <mark style="color:blue;">**Congratulations**</mark>!" "wh...what?" Jack looked up, <mark style="color:blue;">**confused**</mark>, as a <mark style="color:blue;">**crew**</mark> with microphones and cameras emerged. The young man explained that this was all a social <mark style="color:blue;">**experiment**</mark>. Now they were offering him a new life: apartment, job training, and more. They were giving him everything he'd <mark style="color:blue;">**longed for**</mark>.
3. Jack paused. "What <mark style="color:blue;">**would have happened**</mark> if I <mark style="color:blue;">**hadn't given it back**</mark>?" "What? But you did; that's the point," the young man <mark style="color:blue;">**replied**</mark>. "You <mark style="color:blue;">**would have left me**</mark> on the street if <mark style="color:blue;">**I had taken it to feed**</mark> myself, huh? Why would you mess with someone's life that way?" Jack sat back down. "I'll make my own way, thanks. I don't need qualified <mark style="color:blue;">**charity**</mark>." The shocked <mark style="color:blue;">**crew**</mark> members looked at each other and then slowly left. Jack felt a strong sense of <mark style="color:blue;">**self-worth**</mark> right then. He determined <mark style="color:blue;">**then and there**</mark> that he'd work to <mark style="color:blue;">**better**</mark> his own life rather than let others decide his fate for him.

1. In the not-so-distant past, I used to <mark style="color:blue;">**hang out**</mark> a lot with my best friend, Teddy. Instead of <mark style="color:blue;">**engaging in**</mark> casual chitchats about life, we mostly sat back-to-back, focusing out attention to different online activities, such as playing Minecraft or watching <mark style="color:blue;">**amusing**</mark> videos on Youtube. <mark style="color:blue;">**Little did we expect**</mark> that the <mark style="color:blue;">**outbreak**</mark> of <mark style="color:blue;">**pandemic**</mark> could <mark style="color:blue;">**drastically**</mark> change our lives.
2. We were forced to stay home for <mark style="color:blue;">**numerous**</mark> weeks and could no longer interact with each other <mark style="color:blue;">**in person**</mark>. As time went by, smartphone could satisfy me no more and I started to miss Teddy so badly. <mark style="color:blue;">**Accordingly**</mark>, I dialed the number and <mark style="color:blue;">**had a video chat with him**</mark>. As soon as our faces appeared on each other's screens, we, even with face masks on, could <mark style="color:blue;">**barely repress**</mark> our excitement and <mark style="color:blue;">**enthusiastically**</mark> shared what had recently happened to us.
3. It wasn't until this moment <mark style="color:blue;">**that**</mark> we realized we hadn't really known each other that well. We made it a deal to pursue mutual hobbies other than <mark style="color:blue;">**gluing our eyes to**</mark> smartphones in future meetings <mark style="color:blue;">**once**</mark> this <mark style="color:blue;">**quarantine**</mark> was over. From my <mark style="color:blue;">**perspective**</mark>, this seeming unfortunate disaster could be regarded as <mark style="color:blue;">**a blessing in disguise**</mark>.

1. Before COVID-19, people were <mark style="color:blue;">**physically**</mark> close but <mark style="color:blue;">**mentally**</mark> apart, <mark style="color:blue;">**tending to bury themselves in respective**</mark> tasks and take each other for granted. They <mark style="color:blue;">**were indifferent to**</mark> the feelings of those around them and <mark style="color:blue;">**trapped**</mark> in the <mark style="color:blue;">**virtual**</mark> world of smartphones.
2. After COVID-19, many people around the world <mark style="color:blue;">**were deprived of**</mark> loved ones and some couldn't even have the chance to say goodbye to their relatives or friends. In my opinion, COVID-19 <mark style="color:blue;">**serves as**</mark> a wake-up call, reminding the fortunate ones in the world to show their <mark style="color:blue;">**concern for**</mark> and express timely <mark style="color:blue;">**gratitude to**</mark> those who truly matter. Hopefully, people can glean <mark style="color:blue;">**the silver lining**</mark> in this dark cloud and appreciate dear ones other than <mark style="color:blue;">**being hijacked**</mark> by <mark style="color:blue;">**technological devices**</mark>.

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**Given**</mark> the choice of joining Emily for rock climbing or Ted to run five kilometers, I would choose <mark style="color:blue;">**the latter**</mark>. For me, this would be an easy choice because I'm an <mark style="color:blue;">**avid**</mark> runner. At least twice a week, I go jogging <mark style="color:blue;">**on the track**</mark> at my school. However, running by myself can be a bit boring. I think it would be <mark style="color:blue;">**marvelous**</mark> to join Ted and run together. Having a friend to talk to would make jogging more enjoyable. <mark style="color:blue;">**In contrast**</mark>, since rock climbing is not my thing, I'm not interested enough to <mark style="color:blue;">**make**</mark> the effort to get good at it.
2. Usually, when I go jogging, I run about two or three kilometers <mark style="color:blue;">**at a time**</mark>. Running five kilometers would be a <mark style="color:blue;">**stretch**</mark> for me, but with a bit of practice, I'm sure I could <mark style="color:blue;">**meet**</mark> the challenge. I would work up to it <mark style="color:blue;">**gradually**</mark>, pushing myself to jog a bit more each time until I could <mark style="color:blue;">**manage**</mark> a five-kilometer run. To assist <mark style="color:blue;">**in**</mark> doing this, I would also <mark style="color:blue;">**make**</mark> the effort to lose a bit of weight. This would make it easier for me to <mark style="color:blue;">**accomplish**</mark> my goal.

1. Kyle and his father are both book lovers. They have <mark style="color:blue;">**tons of**</mark> books, and have even <mark style="color:blue;">**set aside**</mark> a room in the house as a library. Their library was messy, <mark style="color:blue;">**though**</mark>, because it was not well <mark style="color:blue;">**organized**</mark>. One day, Kyle decided to <mark style="color:blue;">**sort through**</mark> some old books, with <mark style="color:blue;">**some**</mark> to be <mark style="color:blue;">**donated**</mark> and some to be sold at a <mark style="color:blue;">**flea**</mark> market.
2. <mark style="color:blue;">**Included**</mark> in the box of books for the <mark style="color:blue;">**flea**</mark> market was a red-<mark style="color:blue;">**covered**</mark> book <mark style="color:blue;">**belonging to**</mark> his dad. At the market, not many people showed an interest <mark style="color:blue;">**in**</mark> buying anything from Kyle. Finally a girl <mark style="color:blue;">**purchased**</mark> the red-<mark style="color:blue;">**covered**</mark> book <mark style="color:blue;">**for**</mark> NT$100. The red book was the only <mark style="color:blue;">**sale**</mark> Kyle made that day. He felt <mark style="color:blue;">**discouraged**</mark> and decided to <mark style="color:blue;">**pack up**</mark> early.
3. Later that evening, Kyle's father asked him <mark style="color:blue;">**whether**</mark> he <mark style="color:blue;">**had seen**</mark> his red-<mark style="color:blue;">**covered**</mark> book, Kyle told him that he <mark style="color:blue;">**had sold**</mark> the book at the <mark style="color:blue;">**flea**</mark> market and thought it was <mark style="color:blue;">**no big deal**</mark>. Much to Kyle's surprise, his father started yelling and shouting. Kyle didn't understand why his father was so upset. He then learned that his dad had <mark style="color:blue;">**stashed**</mark> ten NT$1,000 inside the book <mark style="color:blue;">**in case of**</mark> an emergency.
