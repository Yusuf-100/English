&#x20;       The central theme of Lord of the Flies is human nature: are we naturally good, naturally evil, or something else entirely?

&#x20;       When the boys gather on the beach for the first time, summoned by the sound of the conch, they have not yet internalized the fact that they are now outside the normal bounds of civilization. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ They build shelters and show concern for the youngest among them. \_\_\_2\_\_\_

&#x20;       Golding seems to suggest that the democratic society they create is simply another game. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ It is notable that at the beginning of the novel, all the boys assume rescue is imminent, and thus that the rules they're accustomed to following will soon be reimposed. \_\_\_4\_\_\_

&#x20;       Golding's question is perhaps not whether humans are inherently good or evil, but rather whether these concepts have any true meaning. While it is tempting to see Ralph and Piggy as "good" and Jack and his hunters as "evil," the truth is more complex. \_\_\_5\_\_\_

&#x20;       Although only vaguely described, it is clear that the adults outside the island are engaged in a conflict, inviting comparisons and forcing us to consider whether the difference is merely a matter of scale.

(A) As they come to believe that they will not be returned to civilization anytime soon, the boys' behavior becomes increasingly fearful, savage, superstitious, and violent.\
(B) This question runs through the entire novel from beginning to end.\
(C) The boys decide to set up a democratic society in order to maintain order.\
(D) Without Jack's hunters, the boys would have suffered hunger and deprivation.\
(E) The rules are only as effective as their enthusiasm for the game itself.\
(AB) They also play make believe and other games, exulting in their freedom from chores and rules.

&#x20;       Two seriously ill men shared the same hospital room. One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for an hour every afternoon. His bed was next to the room's only window. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ The two men talked for hours about everything every day. And every afternoon when the man in the bed by the window could sit up, he would pass the time by describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside the window. The man in the other bed began to live for those one-hour periods where his world would be broadened by all the colors of the world outside.

&#x20;       \_\_\_2\_\_\_ Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their model boats. Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every color of the rainbow. Grand old trees graced the landscape, and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance. One warm afternoon the man by the window described a parade passing by. The gentleman by the window portrayed it with descriptive words. \_\_\_3\_\_\_

&#x20;       One morning, the day nurse arrived to find the lifeless body of the man by the window, who had died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away. As soon as it seemed appropriate, the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window. \_\_\_4\_\_\_

&#x20;       Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the world outside. Finally, he would have the joy of seeing it for himself. He turned to look out the window beside the bed. It faced a black wall. The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his roommate to describe such wonderful things outside this window. \_\_\_5\_\_\_ She said, "Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you."

&#x20;       Covering an area of about 7 percent of the earth's surface, tropical rainforests are found mainly near the Equator. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ These are areas that are warm and wet year around. Average rainfall in rainforest areas ranges from about 80 inches to an almost incredible 400 inches a year and the average temperature hovers around 24 to 27 degrees Celsius.

&#x20;       Rainforests contribute to the planet's well-being in many ways. They recycle the world's oxygen, nitrogen and carbon; in doing so they help influence the temperature of the planet. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ in fact, fifty percent of the planet and animal species on the planet live in the rainforests. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ Rainforests also provide us with food, wicker latex, turpentine, cork, gums, dyes, oils, foods, medicines and resins.

&#x20;       Unfortunately, increasing demand for these treasures is the cause of a major problem: the rainforests are shrinking fast. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ An amazing twenty-seven acres of rainforest are destroyed every minute and one hundred thirty-seven species of its plants and animals become extinct every day. \_\_\_5\_\_\_ If this is true, shouldn't we, as caretakers of the future, do everything possible to make sure it won't happen?

(A) Some of these species could not survive anyplace else.\
(B) When these forests are cut down, the plants and animals that live in the forests are destroyed, and some species are at risk of being made extinct.\
(C) They cover a large portion of the northern part of south America and are also found in Central America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.\
(D) Experts say that a large portion of the world's rainforests will be gone in less than 50 years.\
(E) Other causes include the widespread clearing of the rainforest for farming use.\
(AB) They provide shelter for many humans and animals.

&#x20;       Fiction is the name we use for stories that are make-believe, such as Harry Potter or Alice in the Wonderland. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ It can be so close to the truth that it seems as real as something that happened to you this morning. Or, fiction can be as fantastic as the most unbelievable fairy tale.

&#x20;       Not everything in a fictional story has to be made up. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ You, of course, are real, and the moon is real, and many of the things that you could describe, such as the stars, the wind, and the pull of gravity, would be real. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ It would be a trip you took in your imagination.

&#x20;       Nonfiction, on the other hand, is all about true things. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ Someone's biography is nonfiction; so is your autobiography. So are articles in your local newspaper, and school reports on science. \_\_\_5\_\_\_ Imagine writing history about the 1989 San Francisco earthquake, or a report about a high school sports team. An old proverb says, "Truth is stranger than fiction." Do you think that's true?

(A) Nothing is made up.\
(B) History is nonfiction, too.\
(C) But your trip through space would be fiction.\
(D) You could write a story in which you fly to the moon.\
(E) But fiction isn't always different from the way things usually are.

Besides historical figures, landscape painting was also common in Chinese brush painting. By the 4th century, this particular type of painting had already established itself as an independent form of expression. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ The blue-and-green landscape used bright blue, green and red pigments derived from minerals to create a richly decorative style; the ink-and-wash landscape relied on vivid brushwork and various intensity of ink to express the artist's conception of nature as well as his own emotions. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ A great many artists in the 9th century painted in this genre and their subject matters included a rich variety of flowers, fruits, birds, insects, and fish.

&#x20;       \_\_\_3\_\_\_ Actually, the unhappy marriage between immense ice loss and climate change has led glaciers to be increasingly recognized as one of the most visible icons of global environmental changes. And, by virtue of glaciers' relationship with climatic changes, what I've observed is that more and more, the line between the two blurs.

&#x20;       Glaciers act as veritable proxies or stand-ins for climate change - to measure, assess or explain glaciers is to also measure, assess or explain climate change. \_\_\_4\_\_\_

&#x20;       As geophysicist Henry Pollack says, "Nature's best thermometer, perhaps its most sensitive and unambiguous indicator of climate change, is ice... Ice asks no questions, presents no arguments, reads no newspapers, listens to no debates. \_\_\_5\_\_\_ It just melts."

(A) Substantial evidence tells us that human-made climatic changes are to blame.\
(B) Where there are glaciers, there are people, and the two have been interacting for the entirety of human history.\
(C) Each glacier is exceptionally diverse.\
(D) So when I say a glacier has melted X amount, I'm also saying climate change has altered something X amount.\
(E) This vanishing ice holds staggering consequences.\
(AB) It is not burdened by ideology and carries no political baggage as it crosses the threshold from solid to liquid.

She spent three and a half years undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments in an attempt to defeat the cancer. \_\_\_1\_\_\_

&#x20;       In attempts to raise awareness and funds for childhood cancer treatment, Hill and other members of the Eagles put on a fashion show in 1971, raising $10,000 for the Leukemia Society of America. The next year the Eagles raised $125,000. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ As Hill's story spread, he came into contact with Dr. Audrey Evans at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

The torii gates number around one thousand, and each was given by Japanese businesses or families over time. Each gate has its giver's name marked on it. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ The shrine was created to worship fox spirits, and from the second one enters the shrine site, one begins to see countless statues of foxes (known as Inari in Japanese). \_\_\_2\_\_\_ The main shrine building itself has a gateway with two fox statues on either side, each with red cloths fastened around its neck. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ The key is traditionally meant to open granaries, or grain storage buildings.

&#x20;       Have you ever wondered how body language came about? Is it something we are born with or is it learned through social interaction? Actually, the answer to this question is more complicated than we think.

&#x20;       First, we must understood body language is a result of evolution and can actually be divided into two groups. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ Others are often learned by observation and polished over age and time. For example, we were never taught that scowling means anger; yet as children, it has been programmed into our brain as a natural response. \_\_\_2\_\_\_

&#x20;       Also, in terms of human evolution, speech is actually a newer form of communication. When and how humans began to use words for communication is still unclear, but it is likely it only goes back hundreds of years. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ This can especially be seen when we talk on the phone. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ Without body language in face-to-face interactions, communication ceases to exist.

(A) Conversely, learning to stand straight and smiling we know, as adults, gives us a positive image.\
(B) Although we cannot actually see the other person, we still fling our arms around.\
(C) Therefore, in reality, the verbal and non-verbal interact together as a whole.\
(D) There are some gestures that we are born with and that are considered the same across the world.\
(E) Before that, most of our communication relied on non-verbal cues such as a grunt or scream.

&#x20;       Food trucks have grown in popularity since the 2008 recession and are as much a restaurant concept as family-style dining or fast food. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ Today, food trucks offer menu options from cupcakes or grilled cheese to hybrid taco-waffles, and pretty much anything imaginable. \_\_\_2\_\_\_

&#x20;       \_\_\_3\_\_\_ Vendors sold food from small carts or street kitchens, and the practice has continued throughout the world, especially in urban areas. Roy Choi became one of the leaders in the food truck industry when he opened Kogi in Los Angeles in 2008.

&#x20;       While some food trucks began as less expensive alternatives to brick-and-mortar restaurants, others are operated as extensions of established restaurants. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ It's also a marketing tool that can draw attention to a brand. For example, some customers might learn about a restaurant by ordering from its food truck at an outdoor event.

(A) In cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, the number of food truck permits available is limited.\
(B) Going beyond street food cuisine, food trucks now cater to all tastes, offering gourmet, locally sourced, artisan menu items.\
(C) Popular eateries sometimes add a food truck to their operation so they can take their dishes to the people at large events or for other special occasions.\
(D) Given the low cost, many would-be restaurateurs opt to open food truck businesses, which now are regarded as respectable venues for starting a career in the food business.\

&#x20;       Airbrushing, by definition, means retouching photos to remove flaws or enhance images. For example, it can eliminate unwanted shadows and distracting background images or add a scenic background to a car advertisement to make the car appear to cruise down a mountain road. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ In the days before digital media, airbrushing involved painting with an airbrush. Today, the development of new technologies and image editing software allows for almost endless manipulation of images.

&#x20;       Almost every advertisement employs some airbrushing. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ Some assert that advertising is a fantasy created to convince consumers to buy a product to inch themselves closer to ideals. Some advertisers claim that it's their job to make a product look as attractive as possible. However, the catch is that the images you see don't reflect reality or only remotely resemble the actual photographs. Some argue that airbrushing is deceitful. Some even accuse it of harming consumers' well-being since exposure to overly perfected beauty images can lead to body dissatisfaction, depression, and anxiety. \_\_\_3\_\_\_

&#x20;       With a wealth of evidence suggesting serious body image problems resulting from these misleading images, some companies have come under fire for applying the technique in their advertisements. Dove was probably the first company to respond to this ethical issue. In 2004, it pledged to ditch digital manipulation and present people of all sizes, ages, and ethnicities the way they really are. In 2009, the Advertising Standard Authority in the UK changed or withdrew 2,397 advertisements for being misleading. From then on, more and more leading brands have joined in the anti-airbrushing campaign.

&#x20;       \_\_\_4\_\_\_ That's why authoritative organizations still accept a limited amount of airbrushing in ads. What we need is probably a healthy balance between advertisers and retouchers.

(A) It then opens the debate of whether airbrushing is ethical or not.\
(B) However, if customers were to see advertisements without any retouching, it would be highly doubtful whether they would want to buy the products.\
(C) From smoothing skin to enlarging muscles, airbrushing men and women to "perfection" has become the norm in the advertising media.\
(D) It can also add to models, enlarging eyes, lengthening legs, or increasing the size of breasts.

&#x20;       Since mosquitoes are attracted to skin odors and carbon dioxide, conventional insect repellents keep away mosquitoes by masking their smell and taste. Nonetheless, most people still get bitten when the repellent wears off. Kao, a cosmetics and chemical company, developed a unique mosquito repellent technology by creating a hydrophobic oil surface, which prevents mosquitoes from staying long enough to feed. Mosquitoes use their forelegs to stabilize their posture once they land on the skin. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ However, Kao's research revealed that when their legs came into contact with silicone oil, they would rub their legs together in an attempt to wipe the oil sticking to them. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ Human trials demonstrated that 85% of female mosquitoes that landed on non-coated skin displayed blood-feeding behavior while only 4% displayed such behavior when they landed on skin where silicone oil had been applied.

&#x20;       According to a leader at Kao's research lab, Dr. Takao Nakagawa, Kao hopes to apply this technology into future products and thus help people. He revealed that Kao's lab had developed a new technology with a different mechanism of action from conventional insect repellents. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ Mosquitoes are carriers of infectious diseases such as dengue, malaria and Zika. According to a survey conducted by Kao in 2020, in places like Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, mosquito-borne infections occur year-round and 80% of the population is bitten by mosquitoes on a daily basis. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ Hopefully, Kao's new technology can effectively control the spread of dengue and other infectious diseases in many affected areas.

(A) Similarly, mosquitoes are active in the summer season in Taiwan, and dengue cases arise every few years.\
(B) Therefore, mosquitoes were shown to remain no longer than three seconds, which is insufficient time to blood feed.\
(C) Their legs are highly water-repellent, which means they are able to land on water or glycerol surfaces.\
(D) It is expected to help develop products to protect people from mosquito bites.

&#x20;       Plastic trash is washing off from land to sea. Unlike some other kinds of waste, plastic doesn’t decompose over time. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ They pose a major threat to marine creatures, including coral reefs.

&#x20;       Coral reefs are the most biologically diverse habitats in the ocean. They provide food as well as shelters for thousands of species of animals, big and small alike. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ Coral reefs are built by and made up of thousands of tiny animals — coral polyps. By day, they get much needed nourishment from the zooxanthellae living within. At night, they stretch their tentacles to catch food, usually plankton, from the water. Plankton is truly tiny — mere 400 micrometers in diameter or less. \_\_\_3\_\_\_

&#x20;       In 2019, Boston University coral biologist Randi Rotjan and her team collected several specimens of wild Astrangia poculata off the coast of Rhode Island. They cut open the individual coral polyp and discovered that every single polyp contained at least 100 bits of microplastic. Next, the team provided lab-raised coral polyps with microbeads and their normal food, brine shrimp eggs. When they later cut the polyps open, twice as many microplastics were found. \_\_\_4\_\_\_

&#x20;       Another research even indicates that corals eat microplastics because of their good taste. When plastics come from the factory, they have hundreds of chemical additives on them. \_\_\_5\_\_\_ However, because plastics are largely indigestible, they can create a false sense of fullness and interfere with corals’ ability to consume real food.

&#x20;       With these studies, scientists hope to raise concerns about the survival of certain coral species along with the complex ecosystems that depend on them.

(A) Since most microplastics are as tiny as plankton, this makes them just the right size for polyps to eat.\
(B) If corals die, lots of other species will have trouble surviving.\
(C) Any of these chemicals can be a stimulant that makes plastics appealing to corals.\
(D) The result suggests that these polyps prefer microplastics to natural food.\
(E) Instead, it breaks into microplastics, tiny pieces less than 5 millimeters in diameter.

&#x20;       For those having bad reactions to milk yet still craving for the taste of it, they may have a sound reason to celebrate. A team in Israel has been committed to developing a kind of milk made from yeast, which looks, smells and tastes quite similar to regular milk but will not cause discomfort to people with lactose intolerance.

&#x20;       Dr. Tuller from Tel Aviv University has been driven by the public’s growing awareness of the environmental impact of the dairy industry to launch their experimental project. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ In fact, methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Raising healthy cows is also impossible without feeding them with plenty of proteins, the production of which is yet another significant contributor to global warming. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ Still another equally strong motivator behind Dr. Tuller’s work is the often-reported inhumane or cruel practices at animal ranches far and wide. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ Also, to boost production, cows are often injected with growth hormones that leave the animals with greater pains and physical suffering.

&#x20;       While Dr. Tuller and his team have been devoted to manipulating gene expressions in the production of vaccines or antibodies for the past decade, they are now well on their way to producing a cow-milk substitute. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ Hopefully, this technology can come to fruition in the near future, and can be employed in the production of other dairy products as well.

(A) Farm animals are force-fed in crowded and poorly maintained spaces that often go unnoticed by the authorities.\
(B) Both afore-mentioned concerns make for sound reasons to seek a more environmentally-friendly alternative to regular dairy products.\
(C) That is, dairy cows consume green pastures and emit methane as they digest, not to mention using up a huge amount of valuable water supply.\
(D) They aim to take a gene from a living organism to plant it in another organism to make it a “factory” producing the target protein or milk affordably.

&#x20;       Generous billionaires are not hard to come by, but it is definitely a challenge to find a billionaire who spends all his fortune on charity just to end up broke. \_\_\_1\_\_\_

&#x20;       Feeney, who grew up in a poor neighborhood of New Jersey, is a genius at finding business opportunities. Since childhood, he would take any job to make a few cents for his family—jobs like distributing umbrellas in summer and selling Christmas cards in winter. In his college years at Cornell University, he sold home-made sandwiches to other students and is still remembered there as the Sandwich Man. Then, in the 1960s, Feeney established airport retailer Duty Free Shoppers (DFS), which helped him reach his billionaire status by the 1980s. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ He lived modestly, and often pondered what to do with all the money he made.

&#x20;       Influenced by his upbringing, Feeney decided to give away all his money to those in need in his lifetime. In 1984, the then 53-year-old Feeney signed over everything—his DFS shares and the various businesses and properties he had acquired worldwide—to Atlantic Philanthropies, a charity foundation he established. In the following decades, Feeney donated through the organization more than $8 billion anonymously, to charities, universities, human rights campaigns, and foundations worldwide. \_\_\_3\_\_\_

&#x20;       Pioneering the idea of “Giving while Living,” Feeney is a role model for many famous billionaires today, including Bill Gates and Warren Buffet. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ In September 2020, Feeney’s go-for-broke mission was completed, and he now lives happily with his wife on a pension in a modest apartment in San Francisco.

(A) However, Feeney never felt at ease with the lifestyle of the wealthy.\
(B) He encourages people to donate at least half their fortunes before death.\
(C) This is exactly what happened to “former” American billionaire Charles Feeney.\
(D) Such incredible secret generosity won him the title “James Bond of Philanthropy” from Forbes magazine.

&#x20;       With commercial flights to outer space capturing public imagination, how astronauts or space travelers carry out their daily routine in space has become a focus of attention lately. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ Up until now, it has been a standard practice for astronauts to store and carry their feces and urine with them, on top of their sweat-stained underwear, gym clothes, and else. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ While being far from ideal and environmentally-friendly, it seems to be the best compromise as yet.

&#x20;       A much-awaited change is on the horizon, though. It is a joint effort spearheaded by NASA and a multinational consumer goods corporation, Procter & Gamble Co. (P\&G). \_\_\_3\_\_\_ Other possibilities, such as bacteria-resistant clothing materials and stain removal tools, have also been in various stages of development as well. All these are to make what space travelers wear clean and reusable. Feasible as the project sounds now, all designs are required to pass the test of weightlessness. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ As urine and sweat are recycled for drinkable water, so is the wastewater from laundry. Well, humans have always been pushing the limits in exploring outer space. Hopefully, such innovations will benefit not only astronauts but also people living in some arid regions in the near future.

(A) An even greater challenge lies in reclaiming the laundry water for drinking and cooking, given the lack of access to water in outer space.\
(B) Aiming to solve the hygiene problems astronauts are faced with, the company is developing detergents and washer-driers specifically for space.\
(C) Only when the filth and stink are past the point of being bearable will the load be dumped along with the entire set of clothing.\
(D) One issue of interest is personal hygiene, namely, how they stay clean and dispose of human waste in a less embarrassing manner.

&#x20;       Foods go extinct for all sorts of reasons, most related to human activity, such as overhunting, habitat destruction, and an agricultural production system that often favors a limited range of crops for profitability. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ Transportation and the ability to ship food have made it unnecessary for some species to exist in certain regions when they are easier grown someplace else, but this reliance on a few crops puts not only our food system at risk from disruptions, but it also puts our health at risk.

&#x20;       The food system we've created over the past half-century is a marvel when you stop and think about it. We've efficiently created a system that allows us to have blueberries, lettuce, you name it, year-round no matter where we live. For a price, that is. "There was a concerted effort to change the global food system to produce more calories," says Saladino. “\_\_\_2\_\_\_"

&#x20;       \_\_\_3\_\_\_ That's because eating different kinds of foods helps us consume a wide range of essential vitamins and minerals, promotes good gut bacteria, protects against chronic disease and more. And when you consider the numbers, more than 5,000 foods are at risk of extinction - yes, it feels overwhelming, but there are also lots of reasons to be hopeful. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ Public institutions and governments are doing some of that work through, for instance, procurement for school foods that factor in diversity and feeding students with produce from local farms.

(A) From a health standpoint, most dietary guidelines recommend variety in the diet.\
(B) We are beginning to bring back some lost varieties.\
(C) Today, Saladino says we're learning that complexity in the food system and diversity is vital that it can't be ignored.\
(D) And the loss of some species isn't always bad.\
(E) Post World War II, people were worried about starvation, hunger, all of those things, but the price paid for that was a world in which more of our food became greater in uniformity.

&#x20;       Even if you have never been to Paris, you must have heard of the avenue Champs-Élysées on which an array of boutiques and coffee shops are giving the visitors a taste of fashion.

&#x20;       The name Champs-Élysées is French for the mythical Greek paradise, the Elysian Fields. Though the Champs-Élysées has been the heavenly kingdom for fashion lovers for decades, few people know that it was a swamp before André Le Nôtre, Louis XIV the Sun King's gardener, decided to extend the existing gardens at the Tuileries Palace. Since the royal emphasized order, elm trees there were planted on each side at intervals of 5 meters. \_\_\_1\_\_\_

&#x20;       The Champs-Élysées is one of the most important historical landmarks in Paris. When Nazi Germany admitted defeat in 1944, the crowd celebrated the victory on this avenue. When France won the World Cup, the football fans flocked there to beat the drum for days. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ However, with around 700,000 tourists per day and 3,000 vehicles passing through per hour, the street is gradually losing its charm because of pollution and consumerism.

&#x20;       \_\_\_3\_\_\_ Since it was an eight-lane highway, the architects' framework intended to solve the heavy traffic by reducing space for vehicles and turning the roads into tunnels of trees to make it a greenery public space. The city bureau agreed to support the plan. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ However, it's still a necessary move to turn the city into a desirable and sustainable one. Hope the Champs-Élysées will regain its splendor and become the role model for other cities faced with similar problems.

(A) The Champs-Élysées is the equivalent of the glory of modern France.\
(B) The budget was believed to reach €250m and now it is hard to stay on this figure.\
(C) This arrangement also reflected the French royal family's desire to keep everything under control.\
(D) In response to the pressing need, the committee of the Champs-Élysées announced the renovation project in 2019.

&#x20;       Yep, there's an official term for the way that your auntie used to pinch your chubby little cheeks just that bit too hard. It's called 'cute aggression' and it's defined as the urge to squeeze, crush, or bite cute things without any desire to cause harm. Most of us look at babies and instinctively find them cute, and experts say this is because certain infant characteristics (like a large head and a cuddly body) literally change our behavior. Animal behavior expert Konrad Lorenz dubbed these infantile traits 'baby schema', and said that they motivate us to take care of the child, serving an important evolutionary function by keeping vulnerable babies safe, and increasing the likelihood of survival. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ Just think about how many brands adopt a baby animal as their mascot, such as the Andrex puppy, for example.

&#x20;       \_\_\_2\_\_\_ Well, although it might feel unnatural to think about squeezing, pinching, or grabbing a vulnerable pet or small child, it's really nothing to worry about. According to psychoanalytic psychotherapist Smita Rajput Kamble, cute aggression invites play and has a useful function. She says: "\_\_\_3\_\_\_ For example, soft-boxing someone without making real contact."

&#x20;       Interest in cute aggression arose as the result of research published in 2014 by Oriana Aragón and Rebecca Dyer. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ The babies who had the cutest features - round faces, big eyes - elicited cute aggressive responses.

(A) So, an affection for cute features is in our biological blueprint, but what about this unprovoked urge to crush every little doggo that comes our way?\
(B) Participants were shown a series of photographs of babies, and their expressions recorded.\
(C) Alongside the aggression (fist-clenching, gritted teeth) participants simultaneously displayed caregiving emotions, and reported they had the urge to look after the baby.\
(D) It is a playful way of disposing of aggression, which could have otherwise been potentially uncomfortable.\
(E) In modern times, the concept has even been used by some marketers to make products more appealing.

&#x20;       When getting to know someone in South Korea, there is a good chance that at one point or another, you will be asked, “What's your blood type?" \_\_\_1\_\_\_ But in Korea, a person's blood type - either A, B, O, or AB - is widely believed to be predictive of personality and temperament, similar to horoscopes in the West.

&#x20;       Under the blood type personality theory, a person with Type A blood is diligent and caring toward others. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ Those with Type B blood are optimistic and passionate, but can be forgetful and self-centered. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ The best romantic match is between a Type A woman and a Type O man. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ According to a 2017 poll by Gallup Korea, around half of the population (58 percent) said they believed the blood type personality theory to some degree, while the remaining 42 percent said they did not.

(A) The worst match, for example, is said to be a couple in which the woman is Type A and the man is Type B.\

&#x20;       Roughly thirty kilometers off the southeast coast of Taiwan lies the island known as Green Island. This island has an area of around fifteen square kilometers, and is home to just 26,000 permanent residents. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ Its many wonderful snorkeling and diving spots, as well as its beautiful scenery, actually make it a very popular holiday destination. It is, in addition, one of just three places in the world where people can enjoy a soak in a completely natural saltwater hot spring!

&#x20;       Taiwan's Green Island, though, is not the only Green Island on the planet. The UK alone, in fact, has no fewer than five islands that go by this name. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ Just a stone's throw from the mainland, this Green Island can be reached by either boat or helicopter. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ The first is a two-bedroom summer house, while the other is a small wooden cabin.

&#x20;       Famous poet and short story writer Peter Meinke was born in New York in 1932. He has published a total of eighteen literary works and has won numerous awards for his poetry and short fiction.

&#x20;       \_\_\_1\_\_\_ This poem consists of three stanzas, the first containing ten lines, the second eleven, and the third just two. In addition to this unconventional structure, the poem follows no particular rhyme scheme. In the first stanza, for example, Lines 1 and 4 rhyme, as do Lines 3, 6, and 8. So do Lines 7 and 10. In the second stanza, however, it is the first two lines that rhyme, followed by Lines 6 and 11 and then Lines 8 and 10. \_\_\_2\_\_\_

&#x20;       As the title of this unusual work suggests, Meinke's aim in these 23 lines of free verse is to give some useful life advice to a child. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ He also, however, advises caution, advising the young man to "plan long range" and to "go slow" rather than to live life in the fast lane.

&#x20;       This intense but careful approach is echoed at the start of the second verse, where the poet reminds his son that in addition to seeking brief but blissful beauty in life - "the peony and the rose" - he should also be practical. He should thus "plant ... turnips and tomatoes" among these beautiful flowers and develop habits and relationships that are sustainable. \_\_\_4\_\_\_

&#x20;       Finally, in the short but sweet final stanza, Meinke urges young men to "always serve wine," meaning to always be welcoming, humble, sharing, and generous. This, in full, is the poet's advice to a son.

(A) To nurture lasting relationships, the father recommends honesty and cooperation.\
(B) Finally, the third stanza, also being the last two lines of the poem, does not contain any rhymes at all.\
(C) One of the poems he is perhaps best known for is a short but moving piece entitled "Advice to My Son."\
(D) He thus starts off, in the first stanza, by suggesting that his son treat each day as if it were his last.

&#x20;       One tragic day in 1994, a mangrove forest on Union Island came under attack. The countless creatures living within the roots of these unique trees were forced to flee as a construction company ripped apart Ashton Lagoon. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ For years, locals had objected to the resort and told the corporation that uprooting the mangroves would destroy the marine environment. To make matters worse, the resort project was abandoned less than a year after it began. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ In 1998, two researchers from Canada announced that Ashton Lagoon was "ecologically dead."

&#x20;       Islanders asked another scientists for his assessment and were thrilled when his report was more optimistic. Unfortunately, implementing his suggestions for restoration would be a long, slow process. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ In 2014, both permission and funding were obtained, but it would be another three years before construction crews could return to Ashton Lagoon, this time to resurrect it. After the removal of walls and pillars left there in 1994, the natural tidal flow could resume. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ Residents rejoiced, especially those who had experienced firsthand the protection mangroves offer.

(A) Without sufficient money and permission from the government, the islanders could not proceed.\
(B) In the wake of the initial destruction, the lagoon began to stagnate as parts of the construction collapsed and blocked tidal flow.\
(C) As the lagoon's stagnant waters were flushed by the movement of the tides, the mangroves that remained were revived, and new mangroves could be planted.\

&#x20;       Amber Bourke, the Australian women's pool and free diving champion, is on her way to setting a new world record. Scientists once thought humans could swim to a maximum depth of 30 meters on a single breath. \_\_\_1\_\_\_&#x20;

&#x20;       Free diving is one of the most dangerous sports. Divers descend vertically in deep water on a single breath, using only muscle strength to propel them downwards. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ By 30 meters down, the pressure exerted on the body is four times greater than on the surface and the volume of air inside the body has shrunk to one quarter. When the pressure exerted by water on the body is greater than the force the diver is exerting on the water, the diver begins to free fall.

&#x20;       The ability to survive a prolonged stay deep under the water is a learned skill. When a person's face comes into contact with water, a reflex will be triggered. The reflex prompts a number of physiological responses that promote survival. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ Bourke doesn't know if she has any innate physiological differences. She, however, knows that over a decade of training she has learned how to better use the space in her lungs. Even at 70 meters down, she can still bring in more air from her lungs. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ It was like she was being crushed. But now, she does not feel that pressure at all. She didn't even know this was humanly possible, but it is just amazing what humans can do.

(A) Bourke said that when she first dove to 30 meters deep, she felt a lot of pressure on her body, especially on her chest.\
(B) With every meter of descent, the compressive pressure on the body increases, shrinking the spaces that contain air.\
(C) They include the slowing of the heart rate, and a redirection of blood to lungs to bolster them against the pressure.\
(D) Amber Bourke has gone deeper than 70 meters and this is what physiology alone can't explain.

&#x20;       One of the most difficult things for a human to face is the loss of a limb. If a person loses an arm or a leg, he/she must be fitted with an artificial limb.

&#x20;       The situation is very different for a starfish. If a starfish loses an arm, it can grow a new one. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ Snails can even regrow their heads - imagine what the world would be like if humans could do that. But we cant. Nor can we grow new limbs or even fingers. That's why scientists are studying animals that can regrow body parts, that is, regenerate. \_\_\_2\_\_\_

&#x20;       Many different kinds of animals show some form of regeneration. Most of them are, however, limited to the sort a lizard is capable of, like regrowing a lost tail. A cockroach can grow back a missing limb, but the limb itself can't generate a new cockroach. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ Bidirectional regeneration, on the other hand, refers to a situation in which splitting of an animal will result in separate fully functional animals. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ Cut a hydra in half, and you'll get two hydras. Cut it into four pieces, and you'll get four.

&#x20;       \_\_\_5\_\_\_ A single one can be cut into hundreds of pieces and each will grow back into a whole in a week or so. Because of this remarkable ability, one planarian can be created over and over, giving it a sort of immortality. Whether this phenomenon can be achieved in humans will likely require years of research.

(A) Scientists call this unidirectional regeneration.\
(B) Humans aren't completely without regenerative talents.\
(C) The same thing happens for lobsters, salamanders, and many other animals.\
(D) When it comes to regeneration, few animals can equal the magic of the planarian.\
(E) This type of regeneration is demonstrated in a few animals, such as hydras and sea stars.\
(F) They hope that this line of research will make regeneration possible in humans someday.

&#x20;       Louis Braille lost his sight at the age of three. He was sent to the National Institute for Blind Children in Paris, where he became hungry for knowledge. At the age of just 15, frustrated by the lack of material he could "read," Louis invented a new writing system that changed everything for blind people. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ It allows people with no sight to read with their hands, no matter what language they speak.

&#x20;       \_\_\_2\_\_\_ Combinations of raised dots represent 64 letters, numbers, and mathematical symbols. However, this is only the basic "alphabet" of Braille; the characters can be combined in various ways to create words without taking up extra space. This is important when printing long texts such as novels. The long form of Braille, in which every character is shown individually, is described as "uncontracted"; the short form in "contracted."

&#x20;       Although the invention must be credited to Louis Braille, the system did not come from nothing. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ This was a tactile system designed by an army captain, so that soldiers could pass messages in the dark. Louis realized he could simplify night writing so that each cell contained six dots instead of twelve.

&#x20;       Today, Braille is either produced on a Braillewriter - which works like a typewriter, but with fewer keys - or by computer. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ They can then have it read back by a digital voice. Children with sight problems learn to do this as soon as they start school. Never again will a blind child be frustrated by a lack of reading material!

(A) Braille uses rectangular cells that have two dots across and three down.\
(B) The so-called Braille alphabet is still used today, two centuries later.\
(C) Software has been developed so that blind people can type and edit text.\
(D) At the Institute in Paris, Louis had been given some books printed in "night writing."

&#x20;       Martha Graham was born in Pennsylvania in the United States in 1894. When she was 15, her family moved to California, where she first became interested in dancing. In 1916, she joined the experimental Denishawn dance school and company in Los Angeles, and soon distinguished herself through her forceful and dramatic performances.

&#x20;       Graham left Denishawn in 1923 and moved to New York, where she worked as a dancer and later a dance teacher. Her debut with her own company in 1926 was well received, but from the following year through the late 1930s her highly unusual dance performances were dismissed by most viewers as ugly and strange. Often performing in a plain dress with minimal stage decor, Graham sought to "reveal the inner man" through her dancing. \_\_\_1\_\_\_

&#x20;       An important influence on Graham during this period was her musical director and sometimes composer Louis Horst. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ This solo dance also marked the start of Graham's partnership with the sculptor Isamu Noguchi. Noguchi's three-dimensional staging was a considerable change from the traditional use of flat backdrops in dance.

&#x20;       \_\_\_3\_\_\_ Erick Hawkins joined the company in 1938, and a decade later her and Graham were married. Their personal relationship proved less successful than their professional one, however, and they divorced in 1954.

&#x20;       Drawing on themes ranging from Greek mythology to the Bible to American pioneer life, Martha Graham created probably the most significant dance technique of the twentieth century. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ Abandoning ballet's focus on aesthetics and grace, Graham's work featured distorted and angular movements reflecting the intense emotions of her characters. Though not always appreciated in her own time, she is now recognized as the most important figure in modern American dance and choreography.

(A) Their most significant collaboration may have been 1935's Frontier.\
(B) Audiences, however, were largely unimpressed.\
(C) Her seven-decade career has influenced countless dancers and dance instructors throughout the world.\
(D) Another change Graham made around this time was allowing men into her previously all-female dance troupe.

&#x20;       Copernicus, founder of modern astronomy, was born in 1473 to a well-to-do merchant family in Torun, Poland. He was sent off to attend university in Italy, studying mathematics and optics, and canon law. Returning from his studies abroad, Copernicus was appointed to an administrative position in the cathedral of Frauenburg. There he spent a sheltered and academic life for the rest of his days.

&#x20;       \_\_\_1\_\_\_ He made his observations from a tower situated on the protective wall around the cathedral. His observations were made with the "bare eyeball," so to speak, as a hundred years were to pass before the invention of the telescope. In 1530, Copernicus completed his famous work _De Revolutionibus_, which later played a major role in changing the philosophical view of humankind's place in the universe. \_\_\_2\_\_\_

&#x20;       Copernicus died in 1543 and was never to know what a stir his work would cause. In his book, he asserted that the Earth rotated on its axis once daily and traveled around the Sun once yearly. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ People then regarded the Earth as stationary, situated at the center of the universe, with the Sun and all the planets revolving around it. Copernicus's theory challenged the long-held belief that God created the Heavens and the Earth, and could overturn the core values of the Catholic world. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ Other ministers quickly followed suit, saying of Copernicus, "This fool wants to turn the whole art of astronomy upside down."

&#x20;       Ironically, Copernicus had dedicated his work to Pope Paul III. \_\_\_5\_\_\_ The Church ultimately banned _De Revolutionibus_, and the book remained on the list of forbidden reading material for nearly three centuries thereafter.

(A) Meanwhile, Copernicus was a lifelong member of the Catholic Church.\
(B) The book, however, wasn't published until two months before his death.\
(C) If this act was an attempt to seek the Catholic Church's approval, it was of no use.\
(D) This went against the philosophical and religious beliefs held during medieval times.\
(E) Religious leader Martin Luther voiced his opposition to the sun-centered system model.\
(F) In his spare time, Copernicus studied the stars and the planets, applying his math knowledge to the mysteries of the night sky.

&#x20;       As Parkinson's disease attacks the central nervous system (CNS), nerve cells in the brain stop functioning normally. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ The severe shaking, especially in the hands, may prevent individuals from performing daily tasks like using a computer, shaving, and even eating.

&#x20;       Besides this constant shaking, decreased dopamine levels can also cause other serious problems for people suffering from Parkinson's. They are often unable to sleep well and are less mobile. \_\_\_2\_\_\_

&#x20;       Parkinson's is a genetic disease, meaning it is passed between generations within families. It usually occurs when people are in their fifties and sixties. There is no cure, at present.

&#x20;       \_\_\_3\_\_\_ One found that performing an operation on the spine of a person with symptoms similar to Parkinson's improved the person's ability to walk. An implant made this possible. The other discovered an automatic pump could maintain a steady supply of a drug that performs the same function as dopamine. \_\_\_4\_\_\_

&#x20;       The authors of both studies say more research is needed on larger samples to confirm the results. Even so, Parkinson's patients have reason to be optimistic.

(A) There is new hope for a better life, however, offered by two new medical studies.\
(B) Some lose the ability to walk even short distances and are instead limited to using wheelchairs or staying in bed all the time.\
(C) This allowed test subjects with Parkinson's to sleep through the night without being interrupted by their uncontrolled shaking.\
(D) When the cells that control production of a chemical messenger called dopamine no longer do their job, a person may shake uncontrollably.
