## 題目

### A.

&#x20;       We all know that too much stress is not good for our health, but too little is not ideal, either. While \_\_\_1\_\_\_ stress can be dangerous to the body, short-term stress is actually healthy. Short-term stress triggers the production of protective chemicals in our body and strengthens the body's defenses. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ our body is in a vulnerable situation, a burst of stress will quickly mobilize the body's own repair system to defend the damaged areas. This \_\_\_3\_\_\_ us from physical discomfort and sickness. Small amounts of stress hormones may even sharpen our memory. A recent study found that when rats were forced to swim - an activity that places them under stress for a short while - they remembered their way through mazes far \_\_\_4\_\_\_ than rats that were in a relaxed state. The key to a healthy lifestyle is to keep our stress level \_\_\_5\_\_\_. Too much stress will make us cranky and sick. Too little stress, on the other hand, will lead to boredom and low motivation.

&#x20;       Gesky Krumlov, lying in Bohemia's deep south, is deemed one of the most picturesque towns in Europe. Listed as a UNESCO site in 1992, Cesky Krumlov resembles a surreal medieval town and it \_\_\_1\_\_\_ one of the most magnetic cities in the Czech Republic. Situated on both banks of Vltava River, Cesky Krumlov boasts a \_\_\_2\_\_\_ of architectures, including Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque. Every year, hordes of tourists flock into Cesky Krumlov, milling around the cobblestone streets. They \_\_\_3\_\_\_ exhibitions in galleries or museums, and savor local food in cafes, pubs and restaurants. The best way to explore Cesky Krumlov is on foot. Cars are banned in many parts of the historic section, which are designated for pedestrians. This was \_\_\_4\_\_\_ since most scenic spots can be accessed by walking. In the castle tower, a lot of tourists enjoy ascending the narrow, winding staircase up to the top. Once there, they can spend as much time taking in the magnificent panoramic view. \_\_\_5\_\_\_ visits Cesky Krumlov always gets intimate with it.

### C.

&#x20;       Do you know the difference between the terms _meteoroid_, _meteor_, and _meteorite_ in astronomy? Many people find these words confusing. However, the difference is all about their \_\_\_1\_\_\_. Meteoroids are far up in the sky. They are chunks of rock or metal that speed through space. Some are very large and may be hundreds of feet wide. Others \_\_\_2\_\_\_ the size of a small stone. Most meteoroids travel around the sun in space and stay away from the Earth. However, sometimes a meteoroid will enter the Earth's atmosphere. Friction with the atmosphere will cause it to \_\_\_3\_\_\_ and burn while traveling at high speed. As a meteoroid begins to burn in the atmosphere, it leaves a streak of light. When this tail-like light is falling down toward the Earth, it is called meteor, or a shooting star. Most meteors vaporize completely before they hit the ground. If any meteor \_\_\_4\_\_\_ its fiery journey through the atmosphere and lands on Earth, it is called a meteorite. Large meteorites can cause great explosions and much destruction on the surface of the Earth. \_\_\_5\_\_\_, Barringer Crater in the American state of Arizona, measuring 1,200m in diameter and some 170m deep, was produced by a meteorite impact.

### D.

&#x20;       On the basis of political correctness, people usually agree that it's not okay to bully others because of their religion or sexuality. \_\_\_1\_\_\_, for many Westerners, teasing "gingers," or the redheads, seems to be the last frontier of socially accepted bullying. Ridiculous \_\_\_2\_\_\_ it sounds, gingerism does exist. For those who have gone through such unchecked discrimination, it is real, and it cuts deep. Anti-redhead prejudice can be traced back to thousands of years ago. In ancient Greece and medieval Europe, redheads were associated with evil, aggressive, and promiscuous. Nowadays, \_\_\_3\_\_\_ others, people tend to bully children with red hair. Studies also show that redheaded males are much more likely to have more negative experiences than their female \_\_\_4\_\_\_. Experts are not confident that gingerism can be addressed by expanding the definition of discrimination in laws. Yet, they do encourage redheads to \_\_\_5\_\_\_ their identity by holding ginger-themed events to remind people that they deserve more tolerance and sympathy. Red hair is rare, accounting for less than 2% of the world population, but redheads are absolutely unique!

1. (A) Meanwhile (B) Nevertheless (C) Furthermore (D) Hence
2. (A) as (B) than (C) but (D) that

&#x20;       The Consumer Protection Act in Taiwan was enacted on January 11, 1994. The Act demonstrated the government's efforts to protect consumers' rights and interests. The Consumer Protection Commission, the current Consumer Protection Committee, \_\_\_1\_\_\_ the supervisor and coordinator for the various consumer protection organizations that put this law into practice. In order to improve the well-being of consumers in Taiwan, the Committee advocates fair trade and \_\_\_2\_\_\_ pricing for goods and services. The Committee also organizes educational programs to raise consumer awareness, and is active in assisting consumers involved in \_\_\_3\_\_\_ with businesses or manufacturers. Since its establishment, the Consumer Protection Committee has taken measures that emphasize product safety and sanitation. These measures also ensure that all labels and advertisements \_\_\_4\_\_\_ to regulations.

### F.

&#x20;       Lying is a highly demanding practice. A lying person must conceal the truth and manufacture a substitute story or reality that does not appear \_\_\_1\_\_\_ to every existing fact known to the listener. Such a psychological process usually demands much cognitive effort, which may give people some clues to detect it. People under heavy cognitive load tend to be inactive in their physical movement. A lying person may thus pose arms and legs, blink less, and reduce his or her habitual \_\_\_2\_\_\_ of gesturing. The consequences of heavy cognitive load will extend to changes of speech patterns. Because it would \_\_\_3\_\_\_ for people speaking deceptively to organize ideas in mind, liars are likely to repeat certain phrases, give short and obscure answers, or take longer pauses. There is also evidence that liars tend to adopt impersonal language to distance themselves from the lie. \_\_\_4\_\_\_, liars often use him and her instead of I, me and mine. To create even more evasiveness, some liars will avoid answering the question completely. This is \_\_\_5\_\_\_ professionals of detecting lies will seek to increase the suspected liar's cognitive load and simultaneously monitor the linguistic features. By intentionally making the suspect think harder, the signals of lying can become obvious.

1. (A) logical (B) vertical (C) satisfactory (D) contrary
2. (A) frequency (B) deficiency (C) currency (D) fluency
3. (A) give more opportunities (B) provoke some curiosity (C) take extra time (D) promote certain product
4. (A) At best (B) For instance (C) Above all (D) By contrast
5. (A) how (B) why (C) which (D) that

### G.

&#x20;       Scientific discovery can take various forms. One of them is "serendipity," the luck of finding valuable things unintentionally. Serendipity was at work when Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, the antibiotic miracle.

&#x20;       Fleming had long been known for having an untidy laboratory. One morning in 1928, this \_\_\_1\_\_\_ proved very fortunate. It was his first day coming back to work after a long vacation. Before the vacation, he \_\_\_2\_\_\_ in the sink a number of petri dishes in which he had been growing bacteria. While he was sorting through the long \_\_\_3\_\_\_ dishes of germs that morning, he observed that some of the dishes were contaminated with a fungus, which had ruined his experiment. He was about to \_\_\_4\_\_\_ the dishes, but he noticed that in one dish, the bacteria had failed to grow in the area around the fungus. This accidental finding gave rise to subsequent research that led to the discovery of penicillin - a drug that has since saved millions of lives. Chance \_\_\_5\_\_\_, however, may not be enough to make key discoveries like this. The scientist must have a prepared and open mind to detect the importance of the unforeseen incident and to use it constructively.

1. (A) merit (B) opinion (C) scandal (D) disorder
2. (A) would pile (B) had piled (C) was piling (D) might have piled

&#x20;       The Dublin Whiskey Fire in 1875 was one of the most serious fire accidents in Ireland, On June 18th, 1875, over five thousands barrels of whiskey stored in Malone's malt house exploded for unknown reasons and caught fire. A burning stream of whiskey ran through the streets of Dublin's central district, stretching over four hundred meters and \_\_\_1\_\_\_ up two feet wide and six inches deep. Livestock escaped from fences, and screams from fleeing pigs made the scene \_\_\_2\_\_\_. Famous not only for making alcohol but also for drinking it, Irish people knew how to get \_\_\_3\_\_\_ from the pains of this accident. In the blaze of 1875, many Irish people were reported to drink the free-flowing liquor. Two Irishmen named Healy and M'Nuty were found lying drunk on the street with their boots off, which \_\_\_4\_\_\_ they used as drinking cups. The total casualties of this fire were thirteen people, but none of them died from \_\_\_5\_\_\_ or smoke - they died from alcohol poisoning.

&#x20;       Most of us have the awkward moment when we are called the wrong names by our parents or when we confuse the names of our friends. This is called "misnaming' in psychology. It usually occurs within a confined social group, such as a boy calling his new girlfriends by the name of his ex, or a family member calling another family member by the name of \_\_\_1\_\_\_family member. Misnaming is not simply driven by the similarity of names or appearances; in fact, it has \_\_\_2\_\_\_ to do with affections, too.

&#x20;       There is a mental semantic network in our brains \_\_\_3\_\_\_ the gathering of information. We can remember things because the units of the semantic network are activated and reached a threshold. However, when related units of information in the brain are also activated, \_\_\_4\_\_\_ will take place. That is, a mother may try to retrieve in mind the name of her son but select the name of her daughter \_\_\_5\_\_\_ the intimate connections of the son and the daughter in the mother's semantic network. So next time we call others the wrong name, we don't have to feel embarrassed; it is just a sign that we love them all!

### K.

&#x20;       When we stream the latest TV series, or download high-resolution photos, we are probably unaware that the data behind them is speeding around the world in cables under the sea.

&#x20;       These cable systems, faster and cheaper than satellites, carry most of the intercontinental Internet traffic. Today, there are over 420 submarine cables \_\_\_1\_\_\_, stretching over 700,000 miles around the world. It is not a new phenomenon, \_\_\_2\_\_\_. The first transcontinental cable - laid in 1854 - ran from Ireland to Newfoundland, and made telegraph communication possible between England and Canada. Currently, the world's highest-capacity undersea Internet cable is a 5,600-mile link between the US and Japan. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ named "FASTER," the cable connects Oregon in the US with Japan and Taiwan.

&#x20;       The submarine cables require extra \_\_\_4\_\_\_ to install. They must generally be run across flat surfaces of the ocean floor, and stay clear of coral reefs, sunken ships, fish beds, and other general \_\_\_5\_\_\_. The fiber-optic cables are also very fragile, so they are surrounded with layers of tubing and steel to prevent damage.

1. (A) at large (B) in service (C) by contrast (D) under control
2. (A) then (B) still (C) instead (D) though

&#x20;       The modern pizza was originally invented in Naples, Italy, but the word "pizza" is Greek in origin, derived from the Greek work Pektos, meaning solid or clotted. The ancient Greeks covered their bread with oils, herbs and cheese. The first \_\_\_1\_\_\_ that led to flat bread pizza was the use of tomato as a toping. It was common for the poor of the area around Naples to add tomato to their yeast-based flat bread, \_\_\_2\_\_\_ the pizza began.

&#x20;       It is believed that modern pizza was first made by baker Raffaele Esposito of Naples in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte assigned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza \_\_\_3\_\_\_ the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizza he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pie swathed in the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen \_\_\_4\_\_\_ Pizza Margherita. Later, the dish has become popular in many parts of the world. Nowadays, many varieties of pizza exist worldwide, \_\_\_5\_\_\_ several dish variants based upon pizza. In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was safeguarded in the European Union as a Traditional Specialty Guaranteed dish.

### M.

&#x20;       "Keeping up with the Joneses" is a catchphrase in many parts of the English-speaking world. Just like "keeping up appearances," it refers to the \_\_\_1\_\_\_ to one's neighbors as a standard for social status or the accumulation of material goods. Generally speaking, the more luxurious people have, the higher their value or social status - or \_\_\_2\_\_\_ they believe. To fail to "keep up with the Joneses" is thus perceived as revealing socioeconomic inferiority or, as the Chinese would put it, a great loss of face.

&#x20;       The \_\_\_3\_\_\_ was popularized when a comic strip of the same name was created by cartoonist Arthur R. "Pop" Momand. The strip was first published in 1916 in the New York World, and ran in American newspapers for 28 years before it was eventually \_\_\_4\_\_\_ into books, films, and musical comedies. The "Joneses" of the title were rich neighbors of the strip's main characters and, interestingly, they were merely \_\_\_5\_\_\_ but never actually seen in person in the comic strip.

&#x20;       There is a great flood in biblical mythology that takes over the majority of lands and puts the world in a state of \_\_\_1\_\_\_. According to Genesis, Noah survives in an ark, and after the flood, he dispatches many birds to detect whether the water has receded or not. The first bird to be \_\_\_2\_\_\_ is a raven, but it returns without finding any dry soil to land on. On the 301st day of the great flood, Noah sends out \_\_\_3\_\_\_ bird, this time a dove, to spy again. The dove comes back in the evening with a plucked-off olive leaf in its mouth, and Noah knows the water has abated from the earth.

&#x20;       The presence of an olive leaf can indicate the end of a natural \_\_\_4\_\_\_ because olive trees are very hard. Although the foliage of olive trees cannot survive the flood, the branches are able to withstand extreme conditions. When the flood has receded enough for the leaves to re-grow on the branches, it ushers in a sign of safety. In the Christian world, the olive branch comes to symbolize peace and the end of troubles, as it is perceived by Noah on the ark. At \_\_\_5\_\_\_ moments, people can keep their faith in God by looking forward to the appearance of an olive branch. When it comes, spring will not be far away.

&#x20;       Many people at some point in life have white spots on their fingernails. One of the most common causes for these little white spots is a condition called leukonychia. Although the name sounds pretty serious, the condition typically \_\_\_1\_\_\_. And while many people think the white spots are caused by a calcium or zinc deficiency, that's generally not the case.

&#x20;       In reality, these spots most often develop \_\_\_2\_\_\_ mild to moderate trauma to your ail. If you can't think of anything that would have injured your nail, consider the fact that nails grow very slowly, so the injury \_\_\_3\_\_\_ weeks before the spots ever appeared. The spots could also be a sign of a mild infection or allergy, or a side effect of certain medications.

&#x20;       \_\_\_4\_\_\_ the source of the injury, these spots typically do not require any treatment and should go away as your nail grows out. And they should not return unless you suffer another injury to a nail. However, this generally \_\_\_5\_\_\_ when only a single or a few nails are affected. If all of your nails are showing white spots, the leukonychia could be related to another more serious condition such as anemia, cardiac disease, diabetes, or kidney disease.

&#x20;       In Southeast Asia, there is a fruit that drives Western tourists away but attracts local residents. The durian is widely known in Southeast Asia as the king of fruits. It is \_\_\_1\_\_\_ in its large size, unique odor, and hard outer shell. Typically \_\_\_2\_\_\_ one to three kilograms, the fruit can grow up to 30 centimeters long and 15 centimeters in diameter.

&#x20;       The flesh of the fruit gives out a strong odor that can be smelled even when the fruit is meters away. Some people think the durian smells good; \_\_\_3\_\_\_ believe that the scent is hard to bear. In some hotels or public transportation in Southeast Asia, durians are not allowed \_\_\_4\_\_\_ indoors because of the odors.&#x20;

&#x20;       The durian, native to Brunei, Indonesia and Malaysia, has been known to the Western world for about 600 years.

&#x20;       Most of us have seen guide dogs around. These dogs are ones \_\_\_1\_\_\_ have been specially trained to guide blind people. Of course, it is \_\_\_2\_\_\_ easy to become a guide dog; many months of training are needed to complete the process.

&#x20;       Mixing plant species is how we've gotten papayas \_\_\_1\_\_\_ viruses, corn plants that survive drought, soybeans that stand up to weed killer, potatoes that don't bruise, and crops \_\_\_2\_\_\_ and cost less. That's good news for our food supply and the business of farming. But people worry about pollen and seeds from genetically engineered plants spreading beyond the fields where they were planted. Or what \_\_\_2\_\_\_ harmful outcomes could we have if genetically modified animals mate with non-modified or wild ones? We got ruby red grapefruits through natural mutation, yet "\_\_\_3\_\_\_ are questioning the safety of all the random genetic changes that went into their development," says Kevin Klatt, a PhD student in the molecular nutrition program at Cornell University.

&#x20;       What killed about one-third of the world's population? The answer is the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. The 1918 flu is the deadliest in history, causing \_\_\_1\_\_\_ 20 to 50 million deaths. First \_\_\_2\_\_\_ in Europe, the US, and parts of Asia, then it quickly infected people around the world. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ vaccines and effective drugs, citizens were ordered to wear masks and public places were shut. Officials advised people \_\_\_3\_\_\_ shaking hands and to stay indoors. Even so, bodies were still piling up before the pandemic came to an end.

&#x20;       The flu had quite serious impacts on society. It \_\_\_4\_\_\_ many families. Basic services like garbage collection and ail delivery stopped because there were too many \_\_\_5\_\_\_ workers. In some places there were even not enough farm workers to harvest crops. The global economy almost collapsed. The flu ended by the summer of 1919 since those who were infected \_\_\_6\_\_\_ died \_\_\_6\_\_\_ developed immunity. However, \_\_\_7\_\_\_, almost 90 years later. Researchers announced that a group of three genes \_\_\_8\_\_\_ the virus to weaken a victim's lungs and clear the way for bacterial pneumonia. There have been several other pandemics since 1918 but none caused so much damage. The Spanish flu is also called the "forgotten pandemic" because it broke out during World War I and was covered up by news \_\_\_9\_\_\_ and poor record-keeping. It is the modern day pandemics \_\_\_10\_\_\_ bring renewed interest in it.

&#x20;       It can be hard to convince people that trying to protect our Earth really works. They may sometimes doubt they can do much to slow down the harm \_\_\_1\_\_\_ to our planet. But now, there is very clear proof \_\_\_2\_\_\_ changing our behavior makes a huge difference.

&#x20;       Between 10 and 40 kilometers above the earth \_\_\_3\_\_\_ a layer of gas called the ozone layer, \_\_\_3\_\_\_ the planet. This \_\_\_4\_\_\_, ozone, is extremely important as it protects humans from dangerous rays from the sun. People were shocked when scientists in the 1980s discovered a large hole inside the ozone layer, a hole which has been growing each year for some time.

&#x20;       Later on, in 2018, a study found proof that the ozone layer was getting smaller. \_\_\_5\_\_\_ is the protective covering \_\_\_5\_\_\_ the planet healing itself? The reason is \_\_\_6\_\_\_ in 1987, world leaders banned the use of certain chemicals in products that damage the ozone layer. In the last 20 years, the ozone layer has been increasing \_\_\_7\_\_\_ on to three percent each decade.

&#x20;       The improved condition of the ozone layer is \_\_\_8\_\_\_ good news for all of us. It also proves that we must take the \_\_\_9\_\_\_ actions. Only then \_\_\_10\_\_\_ save the world.

&#x20;       Sugary drinks, candy, baked goods, and sweetened dairy are the main sources of added sugar. But even savory foods, like breads, tomato sauce, and protein bars, can have sugar, making it all too easy to \_\_\_1\_\_\_ a surplus of the sweet stuff. To complicate it further, added sugars can be hard to spot on nutrition labels since they can be listed under a number of names, such as corn syrup, agave nectar, palm sugar, cane juice, or sucrose. \_\_\_2\_\_\_ it's called, sugar is sugar, and in excess, it can \_\_\_2\_\_\_ affect your body in many ways .Here's a closer look at how sugar can mess with your health.

**Your Mood:** The occasional candy or cookie can give you a quick burst of energy (or "sugar high") \_\_\_3\_\_\_ your blood sugar levels fast. When your levels drop as your cells absorb the sugar, you may feel jittery and anxious (a.k.a. the dreaded "sugar crash").

Small shrines, each \_\_\_2\_\_\_ a golden statue of him, can be found in corners and alleys all over Thailand. One distinctive trait of these shrines is the lack of walls and doors \_\_\_3\_\_\_ is the very reason why he is so close to Thai people's hearts. Some people see similarities between Phra Phrom's place in Thailand and Taiwan's omnipresent shrines to Tudi Gong, the Earth God. However, Phra Phrom is actually \_\_\_1\_\_\_ a much higher echelon, being the Thai \_\_\_4\_\_\_ of the Hindu creator god Brahma. Most statues of Phra Phrom are seated and cross-legged. They have eight arms and four faces, the faces \_\_\_5\_\_\_ love, compassion, joy, and charity. He is positioned to face the four cardinal directions, each responsible for luck in a different area. Going \_\_\_6\_\_\_, the first face oversees work and study; the second, love and romance; \_\_\_7\_\_\_, money, health and family respectively. With regard to the orientation of the faces, there is some debate. Some say the "love" face should look west, while \_\_\_7\_\_\_ say it should face the direction of the most populated area so as to have his blessings \_\_\_8\_\_\_ to as many as possible. Since the first Phra Phrom statue arrived in Taiwan over 30 years ago, the rituals and customs around Phra Phrom have begun to adapt to Taiwanese life. For example, Taiwan's important traditional festivals are timed around the lunar calendar. \_\_\_9\_\_\_ the practice, the 9th day of the 11th lunar month has become the "holy birthday" of Phra Phrom .\_\_\_10\_\_\_, the ceremonies are taking on Taiwanese elements.

&#x20;       In a densely populated metropolis, the collective output of waste can spell disaster for both the government and the average public. While most household waste either ends up in landfills or burned up, experts in America have \_\_\_1\_\_\_ an alternative that can turn the waste even to our advantage.

&#x20;       As garbage breaks down in landfills, the organic materials release gases such as methane and carbon dioxide, both of \_\_\_2\_\_\_ can be turned to generate enough electricity to meet the needs of common families. Such projects have currently been in place in nearly every state in the U.S. except Alaska and Hawaii. \_\_\_3\_\_\_ is the potential of the landfill gas that it's recognized as an efficient and environmentally-friendly energy source by the American government.

&#x20;       In fact, similar projects are \_\_\_4\_\_\_ worldwide. Countries like Belgium, Norway and Sweden have cooperated with local enterprises in tapping into the often detested landfills for energy and also for extra revenue.

&#x20;       Born and raised in Taiwan, dancer Sheu Fang-Yi is a sight to behold on the global stage. Sheu found her calling in dancing early on, and \_\_\_1\_\_\_ strong opposition from her parents, she has been determined and resilient in her aspiration to become a dancer by profession.

&#x20;       There is never a shortage of dancers blessed with talent. What sets Sheu apart from others, however, is her \_\_\_2\_\_\_ to put in the hard work to further her skills. She follows a diet with a nearly religious fervor as well as keeping a rigorous workout routine to stay fit. Sheu has impressed her mentors and peers with her \_\_\_3\_\_\_ dedication to her art from adolescence to adulthood, winning a much-coveted spot in Martha Graham Dance Company in 1995, one of the most respected and celebrated dance companies in the U.S.

&#x20;       Outstanding and renowned \_\_\_4\_\_\_ she is, she has her share of setbacks like anyone else in pursuit of a grand dream or ambition. The dance company she established single-handedly did not work out and she even terminated a number of contracts that cost her millions. \_\_\_5\_\_\_, she takes it upon herself to promote modern dance at home and abroad.

&#x20;       The humble-looking piggy bank has a longer history than most of us are aware of. In the Middle Ages before the banks we know came into \_\_\_1\_\_\_, people used to deposit their loose change in kitchen jars made of a kind of clay called pygg. With metal back then \_\_\_2\_\_\_ rare and expensive, clay jars were seen as an economical choice. As the English language evolved, pygg was once pronounced the same as pig, and since pigs were known to roll in pygg mud and dirt, people began to associate, though mistakenly, the pygg jar with pigs. \_\_\_3\_\_\_, in the 19th century, British potters began making pig-shaped piggy banks, accidental yet amusing inventions.

&#x20;       While the "piggy" in piggy bank is a visual pun, the "bank" part actually \_\_\_4\_\_\_ a bench in the very beginning. In the long past, European traders and dealers made transactions in public squares over benches laden with wads of bills and piles of coins, and actually the Italian word for bench is "banco," from which the English word "bank" is \_\_\_5\_\_\_. These days, ancient artifacts of piggy banks are rarely seen, for they must be broken to get the change deposited inside.

&#x20;       For Wolf Cukier, the high school senior who discovered a new planet just three days into his internship in NASA, the coolest thing about his discovery is it orbits two stars at the same time.

&#x20;       In most languages, the word "cancer" probably refers to a diagnosis. In Dutch; however, it is more likely to be an insult, as \_\_\_1\_\_\_ from the word Kankerlijer ("cancer-sufferer"). Generally, dirty words are based on social taboos. They are, in most cultures, related to sex, excrement or religion, and \_\_\_2\_\_\_. Nevertheless, they often feel weaker than the \_\_\_3\_\_\_ ones. Scholars are not sure why. One theory links it to Calvinism, which holds that the virtue of good people will show itself in material abundance, health and hygiene. "There was a shift in focus from the afterlife to this life \_\_\_4\_\_\_, for example, diminished the strength of 'God damn it'," says a Dutch linguist Marten van der Meulen. In this theory, "a curse might be stronger if you used something in actual life, like a disease."

&#x20;       As historian and social critic Yuval Noah Harari once mentioned, when people ask about who they are, they expect to be told wonderful stories. Every generation, or everyone, is looking for the meaning of life. To explain the meaning of life, humans, politicians and religion leaders in particular, have made up different versions of stories \_\_\_1\_\_\_ our needs to explain our unique roles in the universe. \_\_\_2\_\_\_, in search of one's self identity, "the truth" is the last thing that humans want to hear while fantasy is rather favorable.

&#x20;       This phenomenon is all the more obvious in the age of Facebook and Instagram, \_\_\_3\_\_\_ you can observe the myth-making process. We are addicted to eliminating negative experiences and creating unrealistic ideals. That's how a messy kitchen is replaced with mouth-watering food porn and beautiful tropical beaches \_\_\_4\_\_\_ annoying flies and tons of trash on the spot on a variety of social media.

&#x20;       "I'm bored." It's a little phrase, yet it has the power to fill parents with a lot of dread and guilt. But boredom is something to experience rather than hastily get rid of. It may even be useful and \_\_\_1\_\_\_ for the kids.

&#x20;       If kids don't figure this out, they're in for a surprise. Schools can be dull, and it isn't actually the teacher's job to entertain \_\_\_2\_\_\_ educate. Life isn't meant to be an endless series of amusements. The sooner kids learn it's on them to make life interesting, \_\_\_3\_\_\_ off they'll be, because things happen when you're bored. This is why so many useful ideas occur in the shower. When you're caught in a boring activity, you let your mind wander and follow where it goes. When you reach your breaking point, boredom teaches you to \_\_\_4\_\_\_ constructively, and to make something happen for yourself.

&#x20;       It's especially important that kids get bored and be allowed to stay bored when they're young. It shouldn't be \_\_\_5\_\_\_ a problem to be avoided or removed, but instead something kids deal with on their own. In fact, teaching children to endure boredom will prepare them for a more realistic future.

&#x20;       Yogurt is a dairy product made by fermenting milk. The bacteria used to make yogurt are called "yogurt cultures," which ferment lactose, a type of sugar found naturally in milk.

&#x20;       For some people, art is a(n) \_\_\_1\_\_\_ toward the pursuit of perfection. But what if "perfect" doesn't always \_\_\_2\_\_\_ "best"? That's the philosophy behind the Japanese term wabi-sabi, which is difficult to find its proper English \_\_\_3\_\_\_. At its heart, the idea of wabi-sabi is about finding beauty \_\_\_4\_\_\_ within life's imperfections. The most direct meanings of wabi and sabi do not necessarily help us understand this \_\_\_5\_\_\_ idea. Its real usage is best understood by considering things like cherry blossoms. Short \_\_\_6\_\_\_ the flowers only last, they are cherished for their beauty. \_\_\_7\_\_\_, their impermanence actually adds to their appeal. One comes to realize that he must learn to \_\_\_1\_\_\_ their beauty while the opportunity is there. Japanese culture \_\_\_8\_\_\_ examples like this one. Long ago, a Japanese tea ceremony would only be done with finely made, high-quality teaware. It wasn't until years later that tea ceremony took a style that embraced rough, mismatched, or even broken pieces. The imperfections in the tea set \_\_\_9\_\_\_ a shift of focus from the participants onto the experience of preparing and drinking the tea. In that way, wabi-sabi became a key part of this beloved Japanese custom \_\_\_10\_\_\_ its effect can also be seen in the design of Japanese gardens and even in modern buildings that work older, aged pieces into their designs. It might seem odd to smile at a chipped glass or a rusted fence, but the idea of wabi-sabi emphasizes that there is beauty \_\_\_11\_\_\_ in brokenness.

&#x20;       For decades a mature human brain was believed to be incapable of growing new neurons. But evidence was building that the adult brain could, \_\_\_1\_\_\_, create new neurons. In one experiment with mice, scientists found that simply running on a wheel led to the birth of new neurons in the hippocampus, a brain structure \_\_\_2\_\_\_ memory. Since then, other studies have established that exercise also has positive effects on the brains of humans and that it may even help \_\_\_3\_\_\_ the risk of Alzheimer's disease. But why does exercise affect the brain at all?

&#x20;       The answer lies in the fact that exercise is actually \_\_\_4\_\_\_ a cognitive activity \_\_\_4\_\_\_ a physical one. Exercise acts directly on the body and triggers physiological responses such as the release of certain chemicals, which in turn boost the growth of new brain cells. A study of more than 7,000 adults in the U.K. in 2019 showed that people who spent more time in intense physical activities \_\_\_5\_\_\_ larger hippocampal volumes. That's why you should try to exercise every day, even if it's only just a brief walk. You should get your body moving to keep your brain healthy.

&#x20;       Nothing is more disturbing than the mosquito buzz around our ears when we are sound asleep. But why do mosquitoes buzz in our ears? Well, they simply can't \_\_\_1\_\_\_ it.

&#x20;       In fact, the buzz is just a by-product of the beating of mosquitoes' wings. The buzzing sounds are made when mosquitoes flap their wings in flight. Both male and female mosquitoes buzz. But the buzz you hear is most likely from a female mosquito. You won't be bothered by the drone of the males, because they feed on flower nectar, and couldn't care \_\_\_2\_\_\_ about humans roaming around. However, female mosquitoes need a blood meal after mating in order to have enough energy to produce eggs. They are attracted to heat and carbon dioxide, which we constantly produce with our breath. The carbon dioxide we exhale stimulates female mosquitoes to start host-seeking. Actually, they aren't so much attracted \_\_\_3\_\_\_ to our ears as they are to our heads in general, where we expel the most carbon dioxide. The reason why we think they tend to buzz in our ears is that the closer they are to our ears, the louder the sounds.

&#x20;       Moreover, scientists have discovered that there's more to the buzz \_\_\_4\_\_\_ just flying. The sound is actually important in helping them find suitable mates. Annoying as the female drone is to us humans, it is \_\_\_5\_\_\_ to male mosquitoes. Upon hearing the sweet vibrations, male mosquitoes set their wings in a flurry in search of their goddesses. After all, as the saying goes, "One man's meat is another man's poison." While humans try to keep the buzz away, male mosquitoes go after it.

&#x20;       When Microsoft included a series of photos of Antelope Canyon in its Windows 7 desktop background themes in 2009, it helped put this place on the map. Then, in 2014, Antelope Canyon again captured people's imagination when _Phantom_, a photograph taken there, was sold at the highest price in history.

&#x20;       Today, Antelope Canyon is, without doubt, the most photographed canyon in northern Arizona. To be more \_\_\_1\_\_\_, it is a slot canyon, a tiny narrow canyon formed by the powerful rush of water into the cracks in the rock bed. The cracks erode away \_\_\_2\_\_\_, deepening the passageways and smoothing the hard edges of the rocks. The intermittent flash floods, along with the sandstorms during dry seasons, rub the walls of the canyon to appear wavy, swirly, and stripy.

&#x20;       To appreciate the stunning natural wonders of Antelope Canyon, you will have to get down into an unbelievably narrow corridor through a series of ladders and \_\_\_3\_\_\_ stairs. From above, sunlight filters into the space through the narrow opening, creating stunning views. The ever-moving sun \_\_\_4\_\_\_ bounce light back and forth across the wavy walls, creating a dazzling display of color, light, and shadow. The views in the canyon change constantly as the sun moves across the sky. You will certainly be awestruck by its unearthly beauty whenever you come.

It can be treacherous for those who enter since it offers few ways in or out. \_\_\_5\_\_\_ a flash flood occurs, it can be a matter of life and death.

&#x20;       Bitcoin is a digital currency, or cryptocurrency, introduced in 2008. Different from traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by any authorities \_\_\_1\_\_\_ operates across the global network based on a technology known as blockchain. Since there are numerous encrypted transactions, or "blocks," \_\_\_2\_\_\_ together, the chain is not easily interfered with by individuals, which ensures the security of transactions.

&#x20;       One significant advantage of Bitcoin is decentralization. Since no organization and government can control people's Bitcoin, those worrying about how their money is used by banks are free from such concerns. \_\_\_3\_\_\_, the supply of Bitcoin is limited, and no individual can issue it at will. This feature prevents the value of Bitcoin from being eroded by the creation of more money in circulation. Despite these, there are some shortcomings in Bitcoin and other digital currencies as well. For example, using Bitcoin for transactions requires \_\_\_4\_\_\_ expertise, which may pose problems for those unfamiliar with the technology.

&#x20;       Currently, the Bitcoin blockchain has not become as widespread as conventional centralized payment networks like Visa or Mastercard; nonetheless, when the technological, economic, and regulatory issues are \_\_\_5\_\_\_, it is theoretically possible that cryptocurrencies will become more popular than traditional currencies many years later.

For the 4.5 billion people \_\_\_1\_\_\_ safe sanitation today, these reinvented new toilets have the potential to change their lives dramatically.

&#x20;       The aim of the competition was to improve safe sanitation rapidly for the world’s poorest. Thus, the new products were expected to be cost-efficient, and be able to be \_\_\_2\_\_\_ anywhere. Qualified inventions must also meet the following requirements:

* Removing germs from human waste and recovering valuable \_\_\_3\_\_\_ such as energy and clean water.
* Operating \_\_\_4\_\_\_ connections to water, sewer, or electrical lines.
* Costing less than US$ 0.05 cents per user per day; therefore, \_\_\_5\_\_\_ for almost everyone.
* Being a truly aspirational next-generation product that everyone will want to use.

&#x20;       Since 1935, the board game Monopoly has been a popular choice to bring fun to social gatherings. However, the game itself did not merely serve the purpose of entertaining guests or friends. \_\_\_1\_\_\_, most people will be surprised to learn that it played a crucial role in helping prisoners escape in World War Ⅱ.

&#x20;       In the beginning, Germany and her various charity organizations were permitted to \_\_\_2\_\_\_ board games to war prisoners. After all, it was assumed by the Nazis that playing the games would help distract those captives, hence \_\_\_3\_\_\_ the possibility of a prison break. Spotting a chance for a brilliant escape plan, MI9, a branch of British intelligence agency, worked closely with the manufacturer of Monopoly and local charities. \_\_\_4\_\_\_, they stuffed the game sets with survival tools such as the silk map of several European countries, miniature compasses, real banknotes, ropes and knives, and had them \_\_\_5\_\_\_ into the prison. The strategy successfully aided in the escape of British soldiers, and the whole scheme was not made available to the public until 1980 by the British government.

&#x20;       Japanese have a special way to celebrate imperfections in life. “Kintsugi” is a tradition of mending broken ceramics with powdered gold or silver. It has its roots dating back over five centuries, believed to have started when Japanese artisans frowned upon tea cups repaired with metal staples and thus \_\_\_1\_\_\_ find other more aesthetic means of repair. Meaning “to join with gold” literally, kintsugi has artists start at the edges of a breakage to “glue” the broken pieces together. In fact, so popular has kintsugi become that it is not \_\_\_2\_\_\_ to see artisans break ceramics on purpose, only to decorate the broken pieces with powdered gold to highlight the breakages.

&#x20;       \_\_\_3\_\_\_ hiding cracks or breakages, kintsugi serves to bring attention to imperfections of a piece of artwork. As a philosophy, it is interpreted as a way to remind people of human fragility and vulnerability, and to \_\_\_4\_\_\_ past mistakes or missteps as an accepted part of life. Our failures and flaws make us mature and mellow, \_\_\_5\_\_\_ the gold seams or repairs boost the aesthetic and financial value of art. Maybe we can all learn from this distinctive way of viewing imperfections, whether in art or in life.

&#x20;       Denmark consistently scores high in global happiness rankings, and Danish people have some cool words for ways to be happy. The word recently voted most popular among Danes is _pyt_, a term that describes the nation’s philosophy toward \_\_\_1\_\_\_.

&#x20;       _Pyt_ doesn’t have an exact English translation. It is usually used as a \_\_\_2\_\_\_ to a daily mistake or small frustration, corresponding roughly to the English sayings, “Don’t worry about it,” or “Well, things happen.” At its core, the word is about accepting and resetting—a reminder to step back and refocus rather than overreact. _Pyt_ doesn’t point blame at either yourself or another person; \_\_\_3\_\_\_, it helps you learn that not everything can be perfect. But this does not mean that _pyt_ applies to everything. It should not be used when you ought to take responsibility; \_\_\_4\_\_\_ should it be taken as an excuse for inaction.

&#x20;       Today, the word is even manifested into a literal “_pyt_ button” in Danish classrooms for schoolchildren to press when they are upset about something insignificant. Some adults have also started using the button at home. Basically, _pyt_ encourages people of all ages to \_\_\_5\_\_\_ minor frustrations and move on with their lives.

&#x20;       Goose bumps are one of those fight-or-flight reactions of the sympathetic nervous system. When you experience cold or fear, a nerve reaction is sent to the muscles, which then contract involuntarily. This muscle contraction causes your body hair to stand erect. The skin with standing body hair \_\_\_1\_\_\_ a goose’s skin after its feathers have been plucked—hence the name goose bumps.

&#x20;       But \_\_\_2\_\_\_ is this helpful to us as a response to fear or cold? Back in the days when our ancestors may have had a lot more body hair, this might have helped to keep them warm or scare an oncoming predator. These days, however, goose bumps are \_\_\_3\_\_\_ to human beings. Goose bumps, or the reflex that causes them, also occur in many other mammals. Many mammals fluff up their fur when \_\_\_4\_\_\_, to look bigger and thus more dangerous.

&#x20;       Zebrafish, \_\_\_1\_\_\_ their strips, have been a popular test subject for researchers. Only a few centimeters \_\_\_2\_\_\_ length, the fish breed easily \_\_\_3\_\_\_ grow quickly, and their transparent body makes it easy to study their organs. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ they possess some amazing “self-healing” power. When part of their heart is removed, they can grow it back \_\_\_2\_\_\_ a matter of weeks. When \_\_\_5\_\_\_, they can quickly regain the ability to see. Recent studies show that humans and zebrafish have the same major organs and share 70 percent of the genes. Moreover, 84 percent of human genes associated with disease find a(n) \_\_\_6\_\_\_ in zebrafish. Scientists thus hope that understanding the self-healing mystery of the fish may one day allow humans to regenerate such organs as eyes, hearts, and spines. Researchers at Vanderbilt University are particularly interested in zebrafish retina regeneration.

The structure and cell types of zebrafish retinas are almost identical to \_\_\_8\_\_\_ of humans. If the process can be \_\_\_9\_\_\_ in humans, it may \_\_\_7\_\_\_ new treatments for blindness caused by retinal damage. In order to know exactly how zebrafish retina is regenerated, the team looked at the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a chemical messenger in the brain that reduces the activity of neurons. They found that lowering GABA levels in zebrafish can trigger retina regeneration, while a high level of GABA concentration will \_\_\_10\_\_\_ the regeneration process. This suggested that GABA plays an important role in the fish's ability to regain their sight.

&#x20;       The five-pointed star drawn with five lines is known today as the pentagram. It is an ancient symbol which has held different meanings. Today, we can see the pentagram \_\_\_1\_\_\_ as jewelry or designs on clothing. The Sumerians were the first to use the five-pointed star polygon. They wrote about the symbol in records \_\_\_2\_\_\_ 3000 B.C. In the context of that civilization, the pentagram was a character in a writing system. The Babylonians, a culture with close historical links to Sumer, used the pentagram \_\_\_3\_\_\_ the planets. Its five points indicated five planets - Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

&#x20;       In many places, tourism is becoming a problem, \_\_\_1\_\_\_ a nightmare. Some areas are \_\_\_2\_\_\_ tourists that locals' quality of life suffers due to crowding, inconsiderate visitors, and housing problems. \_\_\_3\_\_\_, overtourism makes vacations unpleasant for tourists themselves. Tourism should be beneficial for both visitors and locals, but overtourism turns it into a negative experience for all of them. The UN agency \_\_\_4\_\_\_ promoting sustainable tourism, the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), has made some suggestions about overtourism. First, they say we must deal with crowding. Some sights attract \_\_\_5\_\_\_ as they can comfortably hold. UNWTO recommends providing tourists \_\_\_6\_\_\_ suggestions about lesser-known locations and sights. Some visitors will choose to go there rather than the busy attractions but \_\_\_7\_\_\_ about those sights cap they go! Another way to deal with overcrowding is to set rules about how many visitors are allowed \_\_\_8\_\_\_. Another issue that UNWTO has addressed is the tension between visitors and locals created by overtourism. UNWTO suggests two measures to help \_\_\_6\_\_\_ this. The first is keeping local people involved in decision-making. Overtourism problems will affect some people more than others, and people \_\_\_9\_\_\_ should be part of discussions about it. On the tourists' side, local governments should \_\_\_10\_\_\_ make sure visitors understand local customs so they don't accidentally cause trouble. These recommendations can make tourism a good thing for everyone.

&#x20;       Rudyard Kipling was one of the most influential writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ Kipling wrote, his readers seemed to love it.

It contained many different situations often encountered in life \_\_\_4\_\_\_ some very good advice on how to handle each of them. Another thing that added to Kipling's popularity was that he really loved his country. Although he was born and raised in India, his writing often showed support for the British Empire. Some readers at the time disagreed with his views, and that remains \_\_\_5\_\_\_ today. We must, \_\_\_6\_\_\_, keep in mind that his ideas and tales reflect the historical context of the time. Although Britain didn't \_\_\_7\_\_\_ its colonial rule in many countries until after Kipling died, he was writing in a transitional period leading up to these changes. Therefore, people nowadays still \_\_\_8\_\_\_ Kipling with that period, and we can also reveal aspects of his \_\_\_9\_\_\_ self. For instance, "Baa Baa Black Sheep," "A Trip Across a Continent," and ".007" are all based on \_\_\_10\_\_\_ with different characters that he had during his own travels.

&#x20;       Colorblindness affects around eight percent of males and around 0.5 percent of females globally. The term, \_\_\_1\_\_\_ its misleading name, does not mean people cannot see colors, but in fact means they have difficulty telling the difference between colors.

People with this disorder have difficulty seeing red and noticing \_\_\_2\_\_\_ between different shades of green.&#x20;

&#x20;       Colorblindness is a handicap. In fact, some jobs require their employees to have normal color vision. Jobs which require this include police officer, firefighter, and airline pilot.

&#x20;       Perhaps the most thrilling use of it is in helping restore the walking ability of \_\_\_3\_\_\_ have lost it. Virtual reality has been used to create a safe environment in which people who have been \_\_\_4\_\_\_ can practice walking. Combined with research into letting people control machines directly with their brains, this can help people recover from injuries that limit their mobility. \_\_\_5\_\_\_ in VR program for some time, patients were able to put on special equipment and walking unassisted. These uses of VR are proving to be the key to long-term healing for numerous patients.

&#x20;       “Anne! Jo! I mean, Max!” Mothers often mix up their children’s names, but studies show that moms are not the only ones who make this mistake. \_\_\_1\_\_\_ name phenomenon turns out to be very common. Almost everyone sometimes mixes up the names of their family and friends.

&#x20;       The phenomenon is called a “cognitive glitch” by researchers in the field of cognitive science. It is not caused by a bad memory or by aging processes that affect brain functioning. It is simply a result of the way our brain \_\_\_2\_\_\_ those we love.

&#x20;       When our brain is attempting to retrieve a name so that we can say it, it is likely that another name in the same group will come to our lips \_\_\_3\_\_\_ the one we meant to say. That is because in order to find the name we are looking for, we are essentially \_\_\_4\_\_\_ the whole set of names in that group, which includes all our beloved family members. Scientists also report that the category \_\_\_5\_\_\_ the person belongs (family, close friends, etc.) is far more influential in causing a mix-up than any phonetic similarity between names. Names that sound alike do not usually trigger the mix-up.

&#x20;       Isn’t it great to know that when you call others by the wrong name, it is evidence of your love for them all?

&#x20;       Astronomers have discovered the darkest alien planet known to exist in the galaxy.

&#x20;       The Jupiter-sized planet, known as TrES-2b, is located in another solar system some 750 million light years away from Earth. Reflecting less than one percent of the sunlight \_\_\_1\_\_\_ on it, TrES-2b is less reflective than black acrylic paint, and is blacker than coal. The only light that comes from TrES-2b is a faint red glow, \_\_\_2\_\_\_ the heated coils on an electric stove or a very dim light bulb. Researchers believe this results from its extremely hot atmosphere, which is as high as 1,800°F (980°C), \_\_\_3\_\_\_ its closeness to its sun — its source of energy.

&#x20;       So how does this planet manage to absorb about 99% of the light it receives from its sun? \_\_\_4\_\_\_ researchers are not completely sure, they believe it could be because its atmosphere is composed of light-absorbing chemicals like vaporized sodium or even some elements whose existence is not yet known. Although they may never be able to \_\_\_5\_\_\_ exactly how the planet remains so stealthily hidden, scientists are sure of one thing — there are many more even darker planets out there just waiting to be discovered!

&#x20;       Alan Turing was one of the leading scientific geniuses of the 20th century. Many scholars consider him the father of modern computer science. He was also the man who cracked the \_\_\_1\_\_\_ uncrackable Enigma code used by Nazi Germany. His code-breaking turned the tide of World War II and helped save two million lives. Nevertheless, \_\_\_2\_\_\_ people have even heard his name.

&#x20;       Turing displayed signs of high intelligence in math and science at a young age. By the time he was 23, he had already come up with the idea of what \_\_\_3\_\_\_ the modern computer — the Turing machine. Today, Turing machines are still used in theoretical computation. He also proposed the now famous Turing test, used to determine whether a computer exhibits intelligent behavior equivalent to that of a human.

&#x20;       The postwar era, however, was a disaster for Turing. He was gay, which was then a crime in Britain. \_\_\_4\_\_\_ being hailed as one of the crucial figures in defeating the Nazis, Turing was convicted of “gross indecency.” This \_\_\_5\_\_\_ drove him to commit suicide in 1954, at the age of 41. Nearly 60 years after his death, Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a formal pardon for his conviction, upon an online petition signed by prominent scientists and technology leaders around the world.

&#x20;       Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961) was an American author and journalist. His writing style, characterized by simplicity and understatement, influenced modern fiction, as \_\_\_1\_\_\_ his life of adventure.

&#x20;       Hemingway started his career as a journalist at 17. In the 1920s, he was sent to Europe as a newspaper correspondent to \_\_\_2\_\_\_ such events as the Greek Revolution. During this period, he produced his early important works, including _The Sun Also Rises_. Among his later works, the most outstanding is _The Old Man and the Sea_ (1952), which became perhaps his most famous book, finally winning him the Pulitzer Prize he had long been \_\_\_3\_\_\_. Hemingway liked to portray soldiers, hunters, bullfighters — tough, at times primitive people whose courage and honesty are set against the brutal ways of modern society, and who in this \_\_\_4\_\_\_ lose hope and faith. His straightforward prose is particularly effective in his short stories, some of \_\_\_5\_\_\_ are collected in _Men Without Women_ (1927). In 1954, Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He died in Idaho in 1961.

&#x20;       Road running is one of the most popular and accessible athletic activities in the world. It refers to the sport of running on paved roads or established paths as opposed to track and field, or cross country running. The three most common \_\_\_1\_\_\_ for road running events are 10K runs, half marathons (21.1K), and marathons (42.2K).

&#x20;       Road running is unique among athletic events because it \_\_\_2\_\_\_ all ages and abilities. In many cases first time amateurs are welcome to participate in the same event as running club members and even current world-class \_\_\_3\_\_\_. Sometimes it may also include wheelchair entrants.

&#x20;       Road running often offers those \_\_\_4\_\_\_ a range of challenges such as dealing with hills, sharp bends, rough weather, and so on. Runners are advised to train prior to participating in a race. Another important factor contributing to success is a suitable pair of running shoes.

&#x20;       Road running is often a community-wide event that highlights or raises money for an issue or project. \_\_\_5\_\_\_, Race for the Cure is held throughout the U.S. to raise breast cancer awareness. This race is also run in Germany, Italy, and Puerto Rico.

&#x20;       Brushing your teeth regularly will help you maintain a healthy smile. But that smile won’t last long if you don’t take proper care of your toothbrush and switch to a new one often. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), toothbrushes can harbor bacteria. These germs come from the mouth and can \_\_\_1\_\_\_ in toothbrushes over time.

&#x20;       Many Americans replace their toothbrushes only once or twice a year. The ADA, however, recommends \_\_\_2\_\_\_ a new toothbrush every three to four months. Children’s toothbrushes may need to be changed more \_\_\_3\_\_\_.

&#x20;       During those three to four months of use, there are several ways to keep a toothbrush clean. \_\_\_4\_\_\_, rinse your toothbrush thoroughly with tap water after use, making sure to remove any toothpaste and debris. Store your toothbrush in an upright position, and let \_\_\_5\_\_\_ air dry. Most importantly, do not share toothbrushes.

&#x20;       Hiding herself among the trees near a chimpanzee habitat, Elizabeth Lonsdorf is using her camera to explore mysteries of learning. The chimpanzee she records picks up a thin flat piece of grass and then digs out tiny insects from a hole. Dinner is \_\_\_1\_\_\_! But how did the chimp develop this ingenious skill with tools? Do the chimp babies copy their parents in using tools? Do the mothers most skilled with tools have offspring who are also good at using tools? Here in Africa, Lonsdorf is conducting one of the world’s longest wildlife studies, trying to discover how learning is transferred \_\_\_2\_\_\_ generations.

&#x20;       Lonsdorf has always been interested in animal learning and tool use, \_\_\_3\_\_\_ the way young animals grow up and learn their way in the world. Her chimpanzee study shows a clear link between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom. The chimps make and use tools and have mother-child relationships very \_\_\_4\_\_\_ to those of humans. Through observing chimpanzees’ learning process, researchers hope to gain insight into what the development of our earliest ancestors \_\_\_5\_\_\_ like.

&#x20;       Lonsdorf hopes that by understanding the complexity of animal behavior, we can better appreciate and protect the diversity of life on this planet.

&#x20;       The undersea world isn’t as quiet as we thought, according to a New Zealand researcher. Fish can “talk” to each other and make a range of \_\_\_1\_\_\_ by vibrating their swim bladder, an internal gas-filled organ used as a resonating chamber to produce or receive sound.

&#x20;       Fish are believed to speak to each other for a number of reasons, such as to attract mates, scare off predators, or give directions to other fish. Damselfish, for example, have been found to make sounds to scare off \_\_\_2\_\_\_ fish and even divers. Another discovery about fish sounds is that not all fish are \_\_\_3\_\_\_ “talkative.” Some species talk a lot, while others don’t. The gurnard species has a wide vocal repertoire and keeps up a constant chatter. Codfish, \_\_\_4\_\_\_, usually keep silent, except when they are laying eggs. Any goldfish lover who hopes to strike up a conversation with their pet goldfish is \_\_\_5\_\_\_. Goldfish have excellent hearing, but they don’t make any sound whatsoever.
